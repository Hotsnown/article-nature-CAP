0,Bartlet v. Knight (Mass. 1805) 232 n. 52,,"In this case, the demurrer confesses the facts stated in the pleas. By the law of this state, applied to these facts, the note mentioned in the judgment declared on would be void. The question then is, whether the judgment rendered as this was, in another state, has precluded the defendant from making, in the present action, the defence which he sets up in his pleas. I think not. And that the article in the constitution of the United States *299and the act of congress, which have been cited, do not admit of the construction contended * for by the counsel for the plaintiff, but that the facts pleaded are by law pleadable; and as they would have been a legal bar to an action on the note, so they are, of course, to the present action of debt upon a judgment recovered in the state of New Hampshire on the note; and that the defendant is entitled to judgment. Sr wall, J. By the rules of the common law, the judgment of a court of justice is a ground of action for the party recovering; and tiie judgment is itself evidence of a debt. 3 Com. Dig. Debt. A. 2. Doug. 1. The circumstances of the present case, however, require us to notice a distinction, which appears to be well established, between domestic judgments and foreign judgments. A domestic •udgment, or one that has been rendered in the same court whose aid is required to enforce it, or within the same general jurisdiction, is, while existing unsatisfied, considered and observed as an incontrovertible proof of the debt, liable to no exception or inquiry. But a foreign judgment, though it may be declared on as a consideration from which a promise or debt of the party charged by it is implied or enforced, and though proof of the judgment alleged must be admitted as sufficient evidence, prima facie, of the debt, yet it is not an incontrovertible proof. Doug. 6. This distinction, established by the decisions and practice of the superior courts of justice in England, has been adopted with us ; and is warranted by sound reason, and the general principles of the common law. The extent of its application here, rather than the distinction itself, whether it extends to a judgment recovered in a court of any other state of the United States, when demanded as a debt within this state, has been the principal question contested in the case before us. The constitution of the United States has provided that full faith and credit shall be given, in each . state, to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings, of every other state; and that congress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings, shall be proved, and the effect thereof. By a law of the United States, pursuant to this article of their constitution, the forms to be observed for the authentication of the records and judgments of the courts of justice within the several states have been directed ; and it is thereby provided, that such records and judicial proceedings, so authenticated, shall have the same credit in every court in the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence such records shall be taken. And an act of the legislature of this state recog nizes an action of debt as a process which may be brought within this state upon a judgment rendered by a court of record in any other *300of the United States. (b) Have these constitutional and legislative provisions placed judgments recovered in any court of record within every other state of the United States, upon the same ground, in all respects, with judgments rendered by a court of record within this state ? My opinion is, that the effect of a judgment, that is, the rights of the party claiming under it, and the liability of the party charged by it, are not enlarged or affected by the constitution or law of the United States, or by the statute of this state. The article cited from the constitution of the United States, and the act of congress pursuant to it, appear to me to be confined to the sole purpose of directing the modes of proof and the effect thereof, to be employed in authenticating records, when certified from one state to another, within the United States. And the statute of this state, in recognizing an action of debt as a proper process upon all judgments, whether recovered within *this state or any other of the United States, has not intended an alteration of the common law, or to give the same authority and effect to foreign judgments, which all judgments are allowed to have within the jurisdiction which renders them, or suffers them to remain in force. I conclude, therefore, upon the whole, that a judgment certified from a court of record in any other state, when demanded as a debt within this state, is not an incontrovertible proof of such debt; and that the grounds of such judgment, when impeached by the defendant, may be on that occasion examined. In the case before us, the demand of the plaintiff is for the amount of a judgment rendered by a court of record in the state of New Hampshire; and it is averred that the defendant, the person nominally charged by the judgment, became accordingly indebted to the plaintiff. This demand is answered by a plea which, if seasonably exhibited and confessed, as it now is, by the plaintiff’s demurrer, would be sufficient, with us, to prevent such a judgment upon the original demand of the plaintiff against the defendant as we now are requested to enforce. Secondly, the defendant alleges circumstances, likewise confessed by the plaintiff’s demurrer, from which a want of notice in the original suit, and a want of capacity to defend against it, are necessarily inferred. The process certified to us, and having, as evidence of a public record, the same faith and credit with us, as it would have in New Hampshire, shows that the judgment, of which the effect of a debt is demanded in this action, was rendered without actual notice to the defendant, or any appearance by him, or any guardian for him; he being at the time confessedly an infant under the age of twenty-one years. Upon the *301principles as well of natural justice as of the common law, a judgment liable * to these objections, must be determined to be no just or legal consideration, from which a promise or debt of the party, nominally charged by it, ought to be implied or inferred. This jurisdiction therefore will not enforce, as a debt, the judgment certified in this case against the pleas of the defendant, which, to the purpose of showing there is no debt, are a sufficient answer to the plaintiff’s declaration. Sedgwick, J. This is an action of debt brought on a judgment recovered by the plaintiff against the defendant, in the state of New Hampshire, and the original action was brought on a promissory note. By the pleadings, it appears that the defendant, when the note was given, and until and at the judgment, was an infant; and that he was during all that time an inhabitant of this commonwealth. The judgment was rendered on default, and it does not appear that the defendant had personal notice of the suit; and we know it is not in New Hampshire, as it is in England, a prerequisite to the judgment. The facts on which the defendant relies are disclosed by the pleadings, and the question is, whether such a judgment, so obtained, is conclusive evidence of a debt. If the judgment partakes of all the properties of a domestic judgment, it is so; otherwise we can extend relief to the defendant according to the justice of the case. This depends on the construction which shall be given to the 1st section of the 4th article of the constitution of the United States, and the act of congress made in pursuance thereof. The act of congress, after prescribing the mode in which “ the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings in each state shall be authenticated,” goes on to declare, “ that the said records, &c. authenticated as aforesaid, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States * as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence the said records are or shall be taken.” It will appear that as well the effect of records, &.C., as their mode of authentication, is, by the constitution, within the authority of congress. What the effect shall be is not declared by the statute. It is indeed provided, that, being authenticated, they shall in all events have such faith and credit given to them as they are entitled to in the state from which they are taken. The meaning I take to be this, and no more; that they shall be incontrovertible and conclusive evidence of their own existence, and of all the facts expressed in them. The act, however, stops short of declaring *302what shall be their effect; and congress have wisely left this to the judicial department. As by our union a greater degree of comity is due to the proceedings of our sister states, than to those of states which are in every respect foreign, the section of the article of the constitution already mentioned declares that “ full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings, of every other state.” The precise extent of this "" faith and credit ” it is not necessary to define, in order to decide the present case; thus much, however, it seems to me is necessarily implied, that the courts of the other states shall never be charged with collusion, corruption, or a mere error of judgment. If it be true, in fact, that the judgments of the other states are to be considered, to all intents and purposes, as the judgments of courts in states which are merely foreign, then it will follow, irresistibly, that this provision of the constitution is altogether idle and insignificant — a conclusion which I should with reluctance draw as to any part of the constitution. If my construction be right, then it will result that wherever there has been a trial in another state, the judgment will be conclusive ; *and, perhaps, it may not be going too far to say that if there be personal notice to the defendant, and on his part no disability, that the judgment shall be binding upon him; and it will, in all cases, on this construction, conclude the plaintiff. But I am decidedly of opinion that it would be going too far to say that a judgment of one of the other states should in all cases have the same effect as a domestic judgment; and the present case is, in my opinion, a strong instance to show that it should not. This is a judgment against a citizen of another state, without trial, without notice; and who, as well at the time of the judgment, as at the time of the contract alleged, was an infant. To this judgment I give “full faith and credit;” but although I do this, I cannot say that I think it binding on the defendant; and the mischiefs of such a determination would be incalculable. It is well known that many of the states, of which-this is one, proceed to final judgment without requiring the appearance of the defendant, or even personal notice to him. The return of an officer of summons left with the defendant’s agent oi attorney, or at the last and usual place of the defendant’s abode, is sufficient authority to the Court to proceed to a judgment. An officer may be mistaken; he may act by collusion; or, if neither, notice may never reach the defendant; that defendant may be an inhabitant of the most distant state. Shall he be bound by the judgment, conclusively ? It would be monstrous. I am, therefore. *303clearly of opinion that the pleas in bar, here, are sufficient, and that there must be P. Mellen and Hubbard, for the plaintiff. Parker for the defendant. Judgment for the defendant. (1) Note. — In the case of Noble vs. Gold, (which was decided some years since in this court in Berkshire,) where the defendant pleaded nil debet to an action of debt brought upon a judgment recovered in * the state of Permont, to which plea there was a general demurrer, the court decided that the plea was bad. In that case, they held, and expressly said, that, by the constitution and law of the United States, the judgments of the courts of record in the several states were placed, m all respects, upon the same footing with our own domestic judgments. "
1,Beebe v. Beebe (Iowa 1859) 238 n. 148,True,"It is provided by tbe 7th clause of section 1482 of tbe Code, that divorces from tbe bonds of matrimony may be decreed against tbe husband, “when be is guilty of such inhuman treatment as to endanger tbe life of bis wife.” And then section 1483, enacts that a husband may *135obtain a divorce from the wife for a like cause. The question in this case is, whether taking the bill as true, complainant is entitled to a divorce, under this provision of the Code, or in other words whether he shows such inhuman treatment as endangers his life. As a specific cause of divorce this clause is the definition of that degree of cruelty which in this State entitles a party to a divorce. The language used differs from that found in the statutes of any other state, but is more like that of Pennsylvania than any to which our attention has been directed. The words of their statute are, “when the husband shall have by cruel and barbarous treatment, endangered his wife’s life.” In Connecticut, the words are, “intolerable cruelty in Massachusetts, “extremo cruelty;” in Kentucky, '“cruel, inhuman and barbarous treatment;” and while the forms of expression in these states are different, and while still other forms are adopted in other states, yet according to Mr. Bishop, they are regarded as having the same legal import, and are construed to mean the same as the sceviiia or cruelty of the ecclesiastical courts of England. Mar. & Div. section 455. The leading consideration in cases of this character is, that courts interfere, not to punish an offence committed, but to relieve the complaining party from an apprehended danger. Where adultery, wilful desertion, or a conviction of felony is charged, the party asks a divorce, not because of some threatened injury, but on account of something done by the guilty party, which in legal contemplation releases the innocent one from the obligations arising from the contract, and entitles him or her to its dissolution. In the case of cruelty under our statute, the treatment received is not of itself a cause of divorce, and becomes material only as showing a just foundation for the apprehended danger to life. And this cause of divorce is founded on the well recognized law of nature, that the duty of self preservation takes precedence, and that the duties of this relation are not required to be performed in a state of personal danger. Bishop, section 457. Cruelty is defined to be any conduct, in one of the mar*136ried parties, which furnishes reasonable apprehension that the continuance of the cohabitation would be attended with bodily harm to the other. Evans v. Evans, 1 Hag. C. R. 35; 4. Eng. Ec. 310, 312. Or again, that kind of conduct which endangers the life or health of complainant and renders cohabitation unsafe. Perry v. Perry, 2 Paige 501. Or still again, there must be ill treatment and personal injury, or a reasonable apprehension of personal injury. Words of menace, accompanied by a probability of bodily violence, will be sufficient. Whispell v. Whispell, 4 Barb. 217. There may be legal cruelty without evidence of actual personal violence. Harrott v. Harrott, 7 N. H. 196, and cases there cited. Where words of menace are used, which are merely the language of passion, they are not sufficient to justify the interposition of the court. It is different, however, where they are the expression of a determined malignity, and if likely to bo carried into-effect, will warrant a divorce in order to prevent the threatened mischief, for “assuredly,” says Lord Sto well, “the court is not to wait till the hurt is actually done.” Evans v. Evans, supra, Bishop, section 466, and eases cited in note 1. 'Actual violence is not necessary, and this is said to bo as firmly established as any principle of law can be in England, and the American states generally. Honliston v. Smyth, 2 C. & P. 22; Graecen v. Graecen, 1 Green Ch. 459 ; 11 Harris, Pa. 156 ; 19 Ala. 307. And in Dysart v. Same, 11 Jur. 490, it is stated as a deduction from the leading case of Evans v. Same, supra, “that if austerity of temper, pet-ulence of maimer, rudeness of language, a want of civil attention, occasional sallies of passion, do threaten hodily harm, they amount to legal cruelty.” This idea expressed axiomatically, according to a case much considered in the Common Pleas of Penn., Butler v. Butler, 1 Par. Cas. 329, would be but the assertion of the principle, “that whatever form marital ill treatment assumes, if a continuity of it involves the life or health of the wife, it is legal cruelty.” Under our statute it is not sufficient that the threatened injury shall create an apprehension of bodily harm, merely, *137but the treatment must endanger the life of the complainant. The language of the statute is, “such inhuman treatment as endangers the life,” &c. Any wilful conduct on the part of the husband, which endangers, and which was designed to endanger the life of the wife, can be nothing less than inhuman treatment. So that when it is once ascertained that because of the conduct of the guilty party, the life of the libel-lant is endangered, the nature of the treatment is inhuman or is legal cruelty. Nor is it necessary that the party, before seeking the aid of the court, shall wait until he or she is in-contestibly and beyond all question satisfied that there is danger to life; but the true inquiry is, whether there is a reasonable apprehension of such danger. Treatment, as used in the statute, doubtless implies primarily, such inhuman conduct as injures the body, and thus endangers the life. And yet we are by no means prepared to say that any treatment, whether calculated to endanger life, by working upon the mind, or injuring the body, may not bo inhuman, within the meaning of the legislature. Rut this question we need not at present discuss, for in the case before us, the facts charged relate to injuries and wrongs committed and threatened to the person, to the body of the libel-lant. The only question is, whether they are sufficient to entitle the husband to a divorce. Not without some doubt, we have concluded that they are, and that the respondent’s demurrer was properly overruled. The bill charges repeated instances of injuries to the person of complainant, and that they were committed under circumstances manifesting wilfulness and a deliberate intention on her part to disregard the obligations of the marital relation. If the bill is true, then there can be no pretence that affection dwelt in the household, but on the contrary the wife talked of the death of the husband as an event greatly desired on her part, and over which she was ready to rejoice. She has often said, that she wished he was dead; language which if not intended to be used seriously, certainly shows a reckless disregard of the husbands feelings, and if serious, *138wbo can say that sbe would not execute what her heart desired. Payne v. Same, 4 Humph. 500. And again it is charged that she uses profane and indecent language in the presence of the children, and beats and bruises them in a shameful manner. And this is not irrelevant. 1 Barb. supra, 516, Bishop, section 471, Toume v. Same, 2 La. 452. And that her treatment of petitioner, aside from any physical injuries, have been such as at least to render his life intolerable. Foul and disgraceful language, will not of course, alone, amount to cruelty in a legal sense, but as it manifests a want of self command and the absence of any thing like controlling principle, courts will therefrom more readily, believe evidence as to personal violence; and if often repeated, will give it its full weight in judging of the treatment which threatens injury to the life of the complainant. The habit of the husband to abuse the wife, and his ordinary temper are important to be considered on the question of cruelty. Bishop, section 462, and notes 2, 8 and 4. But the most weighty consideration in the case is, that the respondent, according to the allegations of the bill, has threatened to poison petitioner, and the fear that she would carry this threat into execution, if she could get possession of the poison without being discovered. The old common law illustration of cruelty is an attempt to poison. If the husband does by poison, or any other severe usage, lay snares against his wife’s life,” it is cruelty, and yet there is no actual physical violence. Bishop, section 466, and note 6. It is claimed, however, that there is no allegation of an attempt to poison, and that therefore, inhuman .treatment is not shown. This argument may be stated thus, that an intention to poison, or that state of malignity which would lead to the commission of the offense, though it may not be threatened, is not sufficient, unless some attempt has been made in that direction. And the same argument applies to any other threatened injury, whether physical or otherwise. In this argument we cannot concur. The material inquiry in such cases is, whether the life of the complainant is endangered, or will *139be by tbe continuance of tbe cohabitation. There may have been no act done, in the way of attempting the apprehended injury, and yet the court as well see that there is danger as though there had been many attempts. “Treatment,” or “inhuman treatment,” is not to receive that limited signification which would confine this clause of the statute to cases of the withholding by the husband of food and medicine from the wife, when sick, or where he confines her in a small and unhealthy room to the detriment of her health, and with danger to her life, nor to those instances in which he beats and bruises her so as to cause her to apprehend the like danger; but threats of violence, where there is danger of harm, that is of harm or injury to the life of the party, is sufficient. And this upon the principle that the party complaining has a right to bo relieved from an apprehended danger, and is not bound to wait until there is an attempt made to carry the threat into execution. Eor we have seen from the authorities that actual violence is not necessary; that words of menace accompanied by a probability of bodily violence will be sufficient; and that whatever the form of the ill treatment, if it threatens or involves the life of the complaining party, it is legal cruelty. Decree' affirmed."
2,"Archy, In re matter of (Cal. 1858) 236 n. 107",False,"The petitioner, Charles A. Stovall, states, substantially, that he is a citizen of the State of Mississippi; that he is the owner of Archy, a slave, and as such entitled to his custody; that said slave has escaped from the petitioner, and is now in the charge of one James Lansing, who detains him in the city-prison of Sacramento; that Lansing has no legal authority to detain said slave; and that petitioner desires immediately to remove said slave from this State to the State of Mississippi. The petitioner then prays that said slave may be returned to his custody. The material facts of the case, as shown upon the hearing, were substantially these: The petitioner had been in delicate health for some five years, and, in the spring of 1857, determined to make the trip to California, across the Plains, and to bring Archy, who was a fainily negro servant, nineteen years of age, with him. The petitioner stated that he was going to California for his health; that that was the grand object of the trip; that he did not intend to remain in this State but a short time, not more than eighteen months, and then to return home by water. The petitioner left his wagon and team in Carson Valley, because his oxen were not in a condition to cross the mountains. He also purchased a rancho in that valley. He and Archy arrived in this city about the second day of October last. After arriving in this city he hired out Archy for upwards of a month. Most of the wages earned by Archy were paid to him, but a portion was paid by the hirer to Stovall, after Archy became sick. While Archy was sick, about eighteen days, he was well taken care of by the petitioner. The petitioner opened and taught a private school for something over two months, in this city. During this time he often stated that it was his intention to return. There was proof going to show that the petitioner was short of means upon his arrival in this State. After the petitioner and Archy had been here upwards of two months, the petitioner placed Archy upon one of the river steamers, with, the intention and for the purpose of sending him to San Francisco, and from thence to Mississippi, in charge of an agent. The boy having escaped from the boat, the petitioner made affidavit before a justice of the peace, who issued his warrant commanding the officer to arrest Archy and *162deliver him. to the petitioner. Under this warrant Archy was arrested by a policeman of this city, who delivered him to Lansing, chief of police, who detains him in the city-prison, and refuses to deliver him to the petitioner. This case has excited much interest and feeling, and gives rise to many questions of great delicacy. It is not so much the rights of the parties immediately concerned in this particular case, as the bearing of the decision upon our future relations with our sister States, that gives to the subject its greatest importance. The responsibilities thus thrown upon the Court we must discharge to the best of our ability. In discharging this grave duty, we can say, in the language of a distinguished jurist, Mr. Justice Mills, (2 A. K. Marsh., 815,) that “we disclaim the influence of the general principles of liberty, which we all admire, and conceive it should be decided by the law as it is, and not as it ought to be.” It is only our province to construe and apply the existing law. Whether that law be just or unjust, is a question for the lawmaker, not for the Courts. It is not necessary therefore to inquire whether slavery is or is not contrary to the law of nature. Our individual opinions upon this question are of no importance in this case. The institution exists by positive law, and that positive law is paramount, and must be enforced. It must be concluded that, where slavery exists, the right of property of the master in the slave must follow as a necessary incident. This right of property is recognized by the Constitution of the United States. (Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 Howard, 451.) The right of property having been recognized by the supreme law of the land, certain logical results must follow this recognition. If property, it must, from the nature of the case, be entitledf so far as the action of the federal government is concerned, to the same protection as other property. If permitted to exist by the general law, then it must be protected by the general law, so far as that general law would protect any other property. No distinction can be made by this law between the different descriptions of private property. If, then, in virtue of the paramount sovereignty of the United States, the citizens of each State have the right to pass through the other States, with any property whatever, are they not equally entitled to this right of transit with their slaves ? Is not this right of free passage a right that necessarily flows from the relation that the States sustain to each other, under the general bond of the Union ? We are one government, for certain specified purposes; and is not this right of transit across the territory of a sister State one of the necessary incidents of the purposes and ends for which the federal government was created ? *163That this right of transit with slaves through a free State exists, there would seem to be no reasonble doubt. But, as to whether it exists by constitutional right, or by the law of comity, there may exist different opinions. Mr. Justice Mills, in the leading case in Kentucky, of Lydia v. Rankin, (2 A. K. Marsh, 820,) sustains the right, under the law of nations. In the case of Willard v. The People, (4 Scam. Rep., 461,) the Supreme Court of Illinois decided that a citizen of Louisiana had the right to pass through that State with a slave. Mr. Justice Skates placed his decision both upon the law of comity and the Constitution of the United States; while Chief Justice Wilson and Mr. Justice Lockwood based their decision upon the law of comity. The Supreme Court of Missouri placed this right upon constitutional grounds, (Julia v. McKinney, 3 Mo. Rep., 272.) And I am not aware that this right has ever been denied to exist by the Supreme Court of any State, except by that of New York, in the case of The People v. Lemmon, (5 Sand., 711, 712.) In the case of The Commonwealth v. Aves, (18 Pick., 224,) the Supreme Court of Massachusetts notice the question, but express no opinion in reference to it. “ Our geographical position,” say the Court, “ exempts us from the probable necessity of considering such a case, and we give no opinion respecting it.” If we place this right of transit upon the ground of comity, then it rests exclusively in the discretion of each State. (Story’s Con. of Laws, § 244; Bank of Augusta v. Earl, 13 Peters, 519, 589; Jackson v. Bullock, 12 Conn. Rep., 53; Collins v. America, 9 B. Mon., 569, 571; Forbes v. Cochrane, 2 Barn. & Ores., 471.) Slavery being regarded by the law of nations as a mere municipal regulation, founded upon and limited by the local law, no other nation is bound to recognize the state of slavery, as to foreign slaves, within its own territorial dominions, when it is opposed to its own policy. (Prigg v. The Commonwealth, 16 Peters, 540.) The rule that slavery, when judged by the law of nations, is a mere local institution, and one upon which that general law does not operate, would seem to be clear. From this principle it follows, that the right of transit with property, through the territory of a friendly State, secured by the law of nations, to the citizens or subjects of other States, applies only to such property as merchandise, or inanimate things, and not to slaves. The law of nations only protects such things as are generally recognized as property by civilized nations. Property, only recognized as such by the local law, from the nature of the case, cannot claim the protection of this general law. (The People v. Lemmon, 5 Sandford, 681; The Commonwealth v. Aves, 18 Pick., 217.) Our conclusion is, that the right of transit through each State, with every species of property known to the Constitution of the United States, and recognized by that paramount law, is secured *164by that instrument to each citizen, and does not depend upon the uncertain and changeable ground of mere comity. It remains, then, to inquire whether the petitioner was a mere traveler through this State. Traveling is a passing- from place to place—the act of performing- a journey; and a traveler is a person who travels. In the case of Julia v. McKinney, (3 Mo. Rep., 273,) Judge McGirk uses this clear and intelligible language : “ How length e character of immigrant or traveler through the State may last, cannot, by any general rule, be determined; but it seems that reason does require it should last so long as might be necessary, according to the common modes of traveling, to accomplish a transit through the State. If any accident should happen to the immigrant, which, in ordinary cases, would make it reasonable and prudent for him to suspend his journey for a short time, we think he might do so without incurring a forfeiture, if he resumed his journey as soon as he safely could. Something more than mere convenience or ease of the immigrant ought to intervene to save him from a forfeiture. Something of the nature of necessity should exist before he would or ought to be exempt from the forfeiture. If swollen streams of water, which could not be crossed without danger, should intervene; serious sickness of the family; broken wagons, and the like, should exist, there would be good cause of delay so long as they exist, if the journey is resumed as soon as these impediments are removed, provided all due diligence is used to remove them.” In the subsequent case of Wilson v. Melvin, (4 Mo. R., 592,) it was held that the true test, as to whether the master violated the Constitution of Illinois in passing through that State, was whether he made any unnecessary delay in passing with his slave; and not whether the slave acquired any residence; and not whether the master became a domiciliated resident of Illinois. “in the case of Ralph v. Duncan, (3 Mo. R., 195,) it was held that the master who permits his slave to go to Illinois to hire himself out, commits as great an offence against the Ordinance of 1787 as he who takes his slave along with him to reside there. This decision is affirmed in the case in 4 Mo. R., 598. And in the latter case, the Court said : “And still less will it avail him, that the slave is not under his coercion while staying in Illinois. Under his own inspection, the slave would probably conduct himself with propriety; suffered to ramble, and undertake -work where he pleased, his opportunities to do mischief would be much greater.” These rules were laid down by the Supreme Court of Missouri at a time when there was little or no excitement upon the subject, and when a more fraternal feeling existed among the citizens of different States, than has been lately manifested by many persons of extreme views in all portions of the Union. They *165are, for that reason, the more entitled to our calm respect. They would seem to be founded upon a due consideration of the rights, both of the free and slave States. They are, in our view, eminently just and sensible in themselves, and susceptible of plain and practical application. The right of transit with slaves through a free State is secured to the owner; but this right must be exercised with a strict regard to the laws of the State through which the transit is made. The traveler must pursue his journey with no unnecessary delay; and to excuse any delay he may make, something of necessity must exist, such as “swollen streams, serious sickness in the family, broken wagons, and the like.” The cases mentioned are all of such a character that no foresight or precaution could prevent them; nor could such foresight do away with their effects when they should occur, and those are all facts susceptible of ""easy proof. The question then arises whether the conduct of the petitioner as a traveler comes within the qirineiples laid down. The theory of the petitioner is, that he was compelled to leave his wagon and team in Carson Valley, and remain here until the succeeding spring; that he was short of means, and that he and Archy were obliged to resort to business to defray expenses in the meantime, so as to be able to return home when he could dispose of his property. Conceding, for the sake of the argument, all that is claimed by the petitioner, the excuse alleged does not, in our view, come within the rule. It was not such a case of necessity as to justify the interruption of the journey. The inability of his team to cross the mountains could not, perhaps, have been prevented; but the effect of this want could have been obviated by proper caution. True, he might have been subjected to some pecuniary loss by at once pursuing his journey; but this is amere inconvenience, and not such a circumstance as will excuse the delay. In the case from 3 Mo. R., 274, the same ground was urged; but it was held insufficient. The Court then said : “In this case, we see nothing in the nature of accident to prevent the owner from taking the plaintiff to Missouri immediately. The excuse set up is, that the owner was a widow, and might not have bad the means of immediate transportation of the slave to Missouri; that she was a new-comer in the country, and"" might be poor, and, therefore, unable to do it; that some reasonable time ought to be allowed to her to provide a residence for herself and family, and that one month, in this case, is not too much. We are of opinion, that the excuse, to raise an exception, must be something more than the mere convenience or inconvenience of the owner.” And in the same case it was held, that when a person did not intend to introduce slavery into the State of Illinois, but did in fact do so, the slave was entitled to her freedom. *166But there is another important aspect in which this case may he viewed, and that is, to regard the petitioner as a mere visitor for health or pleasure. And it is conceived that this question is very different from the other, and depends upon the law of comity, and not upon constitutional right. In the case of Strader v. Graham, (10 How. R., 93,) the Supreme Court of the United States held this language: “Every State has an undoubted right to determine the status, or domestic and social condition, of the persons domiciled within its territory; except in so far as the powers of the States in this respect are restrained or duties'and obligations imposed upon them by the Constitution of the United States.” And in the case of the City of New York v. Miln, (11 Peters, 138,) it was held, “that all those powers which relate to merely municipal legislation, or what may, perhaps, more properly be called internal police, are not thus surrendered or restrained; and that, consequently, in relation to these, the authority of a State is complete, unqualified, and exclusive.” In the case of Strader v. Graham, the owner of certain slaves, who were musicians, permitted them to go from the State of Kentucky to Cincinnati, in the State of Ohio, for a temporary business purpose. The slaves were there employed as musical performers, for hire, and then returned home, and afterwards sued for- their freedom. The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that they did not become free. (5 B. Monroe, 183; 8 B. Monroe, 635.) Upon writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States, that Court held it bad no jurisdiction of the case, as no law of the Union was involved in its determination. The question, whether a citizen of a sister State shall be permitted to remain a reasonable time simply as a visitor with his slaves, and under what conditions, is a question purely of local jurisdiction, and must depend upon the peculiar policy and situation of each State. It is insisted by the learned counsel for Archy that the question of comity is one for the Legislature to determine, and not for the Courts. This is certainly a very important power, and one that partakes of a mixed character. It is both legislative and judicial. It would seem almost impracticable for the Legislature to provide for all the instances where the law of comity must be applied. And until the Legislature does make provision,""the Courts are under the necessity of determining how far the rule of comity must apply. Such has been the practice of the Courts, as stated by Judge Story, in his Con. of Laws, page 25. So, also, Chief Justice Parker, in the case of Blanchard v. Russel, (13 Mass. Rep., 6,) says: “As the laws of foreign countries are not admitted ex proprio vigore, but only ex comitate, the judicial power will exercise a discretion with respect to the laws they may be called upon to sanction; for if they *167should be manifestly unjust, or calculated to injure their own citizens, they ought to be rejected."" The same principle was asserted by Mr. Justice Lockwood, in his able opinion in the case of Willard v. The People, (4 Scam., 474.) After stating the principle, the learned Justice asks: “Is the case presented in the record of such a character as to appeal to the sound discretion of this Court to enforce the laws and institutions of a sister State ? In answering this question, regard should be had to the geographical position of Illinois, as well as to the relations we sustain to our sister States, confederated under the same general government."" We conceive it to be the right of the judiciary, especially in the absence of any legislation upon the subject, to determine how far the situation of this State, its policy, and condition, would justify us in giving effect, for a temporary period, to the laws and institutions of other States within our own territorial limits. This question, we conceive, should be decided with a sincere desire to extend to our fellow-citizens of other States, all the hospitalities consistent with our own just rights. The geographical position of California, with respect to the other States of the Union, is peculiar. Such is our situation, that a citizen of a slave State will scarcely, if ever, wish to pass through this State with his slave, as a mere traveler, either for business or pleasure. But our position, climate, and productions, all naturally invite our fellow-citizens as visitors. When they come to visit us, for health or pleasure, shall they be permitted to bring their domestic servants with them, to attend upon them or their families as waiters ? The citizens of the free States can bring- their confidential servants with them—why should not the citizens of the slave States be allowed the same privilege ? It is true, the domestics in the one*case are hired servants, while in the other they are slaves. But should this induce us to exclude the one and admit the other? Persons who live in the slave States, and have long been accustomed to their own domestics, who constitute, in fact, a part of the family, very naturally desire, in making visits, to take these domestics with them, especially when they come as invalids seeking for health. It is our policy and duty not to clog the privilege of visiting us, with unnecessary restrictions. We look forward to the day when California will be frequented by visitors from all parts of the Union. We have every reason to expect it. But this privilege should be confined strictly to mere visitors, and not extended to those who come for both business and pleasure. And the character of visitor should be determined solely by the acts of the person, and not by his declarations. In a case like this, we conceive the declarations of a party, or his intentions, constitute no tost and no evidence. The Supreme Court of Missouri was right, when deciding that, though a par*168ty did not intend to introduce slavery into Illinois, but did in fact do so, he incurred a forfeiture of his slave. The fact of intention is often difficult to ascertain; it is the secret and invisible determination of the mind; and, unless shown by outward acts, cannot be known. On the contrary, the visible acts of a party are susceptible of easy proof, and the inquiry becomes simple and certain. As acts must constitute the true test, whether the party be a mere visitor or not, those acts should be clearly defined, that the party may know the exact extent of the privilege granted. In our view, a mere visitor is one who comes only for pleasure or health, and who engages in no business while here, and remains only for a reasonable time. If the party engages in any business himself, or employ his slave in any business, except as a mere personal attendant upon himself, or family, then the character of visitor is lost, and his slave is entitled to freedom; and we cannot admit of any exception to this rule, upon the ground of necessity or misfortune. Were we to do so, it would introduce uncertainty and complexity, and lead our Courts into profitless investigations. We cannot ascertain, with any certainty, the pecuniary condition of the party. It is a matter difficult to show. He may have ample means, and yet have the appearance of present poverty. This is a question we will not inquire into; we prefer a plain, practical, and efficient rule •, one that all can understand and follow. It is true that unforeseen losses may sometimes occur to visitors ; but there are so many ways in which their effects may be obviated, without engaging in business, that we cannot relax the rule to meet the hardships of a particular case. Prudence and foresight will guard against these pecuniary losses, in most cases; and, if not in all, it must be regarded as the misfortune'of the visitor. In the case of Julia v. McKinney, already referred to, it was decided by the Supreme Court of Missouri, that the hiring out of the slave for one or two days, in the State of Illinois, incurred a forfeiture, under the second section of the sixth article of the Constitution of that State. That section provided “ that no person bound to labor in any other State, shall be hired to labor in this State, except within the tract reserved for the salt works,” etc. There is no such provision in our Constitution; but the question arises whether such a prohibition does not necessarily result from the general principle. This section in the Constitution of Illinois was necessary, to mark the exception to the general rule excluding slavery from the State. Had no exception been intended, then it is conceived that such a provision would have been unnecessary. But if a citizen of another State should be permitted to hire out his slave, or use his labor in the prosecution of any business, even for a temporary period, and with *169the intent to return again to his own State, it would, in our opinion, be a violation of the Constitution of this State. It was the very purpose of the Constitution to prohibit such a state of things. It would be allowing a privilege to the citizens of other States, in the prosecution of their business in this State, which our Constitution denies to our own citizens. This is a privilege thafr-the Constitution of the United States does not secure to the citizens of other States. The provision that “ the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States,” secures to a citizen from home, in a sister State, the privileges enjoyed by the citizens of the State where he is a sojourner, and no more. If put upon an equality with our own citizens, in the prosecution of his business in this State, there can be no just ground for complaint. The sojourner has no right to enter with slave-labor into business competition with those who are not allowed the same privilege. Even in the1 case of a fugitive slave, the owner has only the right, under the Constitution of the United States, to remove him from the free State in which he may be found, and not the right to employ him in labor, even for a temporary period and purpose. But to allow mere visitors to this State, for pleasure or health, to bring with them, as personal attendants, their own domestics, is not, in our view, any violation of the end contemplated by the Constitution of this State. Such a rule will not, in its general operation, interfere with the business or social condition of our own citizens. It is insisted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the provision of the eighteenth section of the first article of the Constitution of this State—that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for the punishment of crimes, shall ever be tolerated in this State”—is merely directory to the Legislature; and until some act is passed by that body to give effect to this constitutional provision, it remains dormant and inoperative. In support of this view, we are referred to the case of Graves and others v. Slaughter, (14 Peters, 449,) and to the opinion of Mr. Justice Anderson, in the case of Perkins, (2 Cal. R., 424, 455.) The case reported in Peters was a suit upon a promissory note given for slaves introduced into the State of Mississippi as merchandise. The Constitution of that State provided that “the introduction of slaves into this State as merchandise, or for sale, shall be prohibited from and after the first day of May, 1833,” with an exception as to such as may be introduced by actual settlers previous to the year 1845. Mr. Justice Thompson who delivered the opinion of the Court, said-: “ This obviously points to something more to be done, and looks to some future time, *170not only for its fulfillment, but for the means by which it was to be accomplished.” It will be seen that the provision regards the introduction of slaves for certain purposes, and that it does not, either expressly or by logical deduction, declare the consequences of its violation. Whether the slaves thus introduced were to be free, or whether the person who introduced them should be punished criminally, cannot be known from the provision itself. This provision, from its language and the purpose to be accomplished, could only depend upon future legislation to carry it into effect. It did not, in and of itself, and by its own innate force, operate upon the State of the slave, after being introduced into the State. But the provision in our Constitution is entirely different, both in its language and in the logical deductions flowing from it. It is negative and restrictive in its terms and effect, and by its own force accomplishes the end aimed at. It operates directly upon the state of individuals within our own territorial limits, and provides that the state of slavery should not exist therein. And when the state of slavery is abolished, then each individual is placed upon an equality, and in the contemplation of the Constitution, equally free, with all the incidents necessarily attached to the state of freedom. This provision of the Constitution was operative from the time the other provisions became operative. It was not a provision addressed solely to the legislative conscience, and dependent upon future legislation to carry it into practical effect. It is difficult to conceive how a negative and restrictive provision of the Constitution can be merely directory. When power is withheld, or a certain state prohibited, the provision must, from the very nature of the case, be conclusive. True, such a provision may be addressed solely to the Legislature, or to the Executive, and not to the Courts. But, when so addressed, there should be something, either in the language of the instrument or in the nature of the provision itself, to show that the judiciary have nothing to do with cases arising under it. In the case of Rankin v. Lydia, (2 A. K. Marsh., 470,) we have an authority in point. The ordinance of Congress for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio, contained this provision: “ There shall he neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said Territory, other than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. Provided, always, that any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor, as aforesaid.” It will be seen, upon comparison, how similar in substance is the language of this provision and that of the Constitution of *171this State. The learned Judge who delivered the opinion of the Court in that case, said : “ The words of the ordinance are extremely clear and forcible—‘there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude’—a strong mode of expressing that every inhabitant shall be free; thus using a figure of speech not uncommon, which, by expressing what shall not, declares emphatically what shall be. If a slave, then, could exist and reside in the Territory, and be there a slave, the ordinance could not be true; for slavery existed, the ordinance notwithstanding.” We must think that the case reported in 14 Peters, already referred to, has no application to this provision of the Constitution of California; and that the learned Justice of this Court was mistaken in its application. It will be seen from the separate opinion of the Chief Justice, that he did not take the same view of this authority as did Mr. Justice Anderson. At least, there is nothing in the opinion to show that the Chief Justice relied upon this authority to sustain his decision. From the views we have expressed, it would seem clear that the petitioner cannot sustain either the character of traveler or visitor. But there are circumstances connected with this particular case that may exempt him from the operation of the rules we have laid down. This is the first case that has occurred under the existing law; and from the opinion of Mr. Justice Anderson, and the silence of the Chief Justice, the petitioner had some reason to believe that the constitutional provision would have no immediate operation. This is the first case; and under these circumstances we are not disposed to rigidly enforce the rule for the first time. But, in reference to all future cases, it is our purpose to enforce the rules laid down strictly, according to their true intent and spirit.' It is therefore ordered, that Arehy be forthwith released from the custody of the Chief of Police, and given into the custody of the petitioner, Charles A. Stovall. Terry, C. J. I concur in the judgment, and in the principles announced in the opinion of my associate; while I do not entirely agree with his conclusions from the facts of the case. 1 think the delay of the petitioner was unavoidable, and that the fact of his engaging in labor in order to support himself during his necessary detention, did not divest his rights under the law of comity, as laid down in the opinion. "
3,"Arnold v. Mundy (N.J. 1821) 156, 233 nn. 73–77",," Abating a little want of courteousness towards the memory of some of the greatest luminaries of the English law, and indeed I may say, some of the greatest men that ever lived, I have been much gratified by the arguments presented by the counsel in this cause.. They have investigated- the subject with great dare, and great ability, and they have certainly thrown much new light upon the view in which it had before exhibited itself to my mind. The principal question, however, which it presents, and which is now to be determined, is a new question; it has never before come, up before the courts of justice in this shape, and in this direct manner, since the first settlement *11of tlie province. It is a question of great importance; it involves immense interests; it lies at the foundation of all the rights of fishery hitherto claimed or exercised in the state of New Jersey. N That such a question cannot be ultimately decided, or even beneficially discussed, in hastily rendering an opinion upon a motion for a non-suit at a circuit court, must be manifest to all; and yot, at tho same time, what might be said upon it might prove to be exceedingly injurious, by exciting false hopes or false fears, by encouraging those who claim a common right- to make unlawful aggressions, or those who claim several rights to make unlawful defences, and in their conflict for superiority, for awhile, not only to disturb the peace of society but also to destroy the very subject matter of controversy. If it were possible, therefore, to avoid the expression of an opinion at present, and to take a verdict for the damages only, subject to the opinion of the court at bar upon the title, and that too with leave to either party to put the case in such form as that it might be carried up to the court of appeals, as is sometimes done, it would be exceedingly agreeable to me. This, however, I know can be done only by the consent and agreement of the parties, and it is with that view I propose it, and with that view would beg leave to submit it to their consideration. [The defendant declined tho proposition, and called for the opinion of the court, when I proceeded.] Constrained, as I am, to render an opinion in this hasty manner, I shall merely state my present views of the right which the plaintiff has exhibited, as concisely as I am able, and that without recurring either to books or arguments to support them. Tho action is for a trespass in entering upon the plaintiff’s oyster bed, and taking and carrying away his oysters. To support this action, the plaintiff must shew a title in himself. This title, in ordinary cases, may be either a fee *12simple, or a possession accompanied by right, without a fee simple, or an actual and exclusive possession, without either the fee simple or the right, for such possession is good against all the world, till a better right is shewn. To make out this title, the plaintiff has attempted to shew — 1. In the first place, an actual and exclusive possession. 2. In the second place, a possession accompanied by right. 3. In the third place, a fee simple under the proprietors of New Jersey. As to the first and second of these, they are no other way proved than by shewing the conveyance for, and the possession' of, certain lands upon, the shore opposite to this bed, extending, to make the most of-it, to low water mark only; and by shewing further, the staking off the said bed, the planting of oysters upon it, and sometimes fishing there, as other people, also, sometimes did. Upon this I observe, that a grant of land to a subject or citizen, bounded upon a fresh water stream or river, where the tide neither ebbs nor flows, extends to the middle of the channel of such river; but that a grant bounded upon a navigable river, or other water, where the tide does ebb or flow, extends to the edge of the water only, that is to say, to high water mark, when the tide is high, and to low water • mark, when the tide is low, but it extends no farther. . The intermediate space, however, between the high water and low water mark, may be exclusively appropriated by the owner of the adjacent land, by building thereon docks, wharves, storehouses, salt-pans, or other structures which exclude the reflow of the water. All pretence of claim, therefore, to this bed, founded upon the possession of the adjacent land, must fail. And if the plaintiff would set up a possession founded upon another right, that is, upon his staking off the bed, planting oysters upon it, and sometimes fishing there, even if it were a subject matter which could be taken possession of in that way, that possession has not been proved to be either so continued or *13so exclusivo as to establish his right against those having equal claim with, himself. lie sets up no prescription ; he shews no grant to support such possession. He places himself in the situation of a fisherman, who, because he has fished in certain waters for many years, should claim the exclusive possession and the exclusive right. Then, as to the title derived from the proprietors. And first of the form of their conveyance; and then of their right to convey. 1. The proprietors of How Jersey are tenants in common of the soil; their mode of severing this common right is by issuing warrants, from time to time, to the respective proprietors, according to their respective and several rights, authorizing them to survey and appropriate in severalty the quantities therein contained. Such warrant does not convey a title to the proprietor; he had that before. It only authorizes him to sever so much from the common stock, and operates as a release to testify such severance. This is manifestly the case, when the proprietor locates for himself. When, instead of locating for himself, he sells his warrant to another, that other becomes a tenant in common with all the proprietors pro tanto, and in the same manner he proceeds to convert his common into a several right. Eegulariy there is a deed of conveyance upon the transfer of this ■warrant, and that deed of conveyance is the foundation of the title of the transferee. If is true, that the survey made in pursuance of this warrant must be inspected by the surveyor-general, approved by the board, and registered in their hooks ; but all this is for the sake of security, order, and regularity only, and is by no means the passing of the title. It proves the title has passed, but it is not the means of passing it. It may he likened to the acknowledgment of a deed by a married woman. Her deed cannot prevail against her unless such acknowlegdraent he regularly made and recorded; yet such acknowledgment does not pass the title, the deed has already *14done that, and it operates from the day of its date. Upon this exception to the plaintiff’s title, therefore, I think' the defendant must fail. In this case, the warrant and the survey were before the trespass charged, but the recording of it was said to be after. The date of the recording was not mentioned on the 'record. 2. Then as to the right of the proprietors to convey. And upon this I am of opinion, that by the law of nature, which is the only true foundation of all the social rights, that by the civil law, which formerly govérned almost all the civilized world, and which is still the foundation of the polity.of almost every nation in Europe; that by the common law of England, of which our ancestors boasted, and to which it were well if ourselves paid a more sacred regard; I say I am of opinion, that, by all these, the navigable rivers, where the tide ebbs and flows, the ports, the bays, the coasts of the sea, including both the water and the land under the water, for the purposes of passing and repassing, navigation, fishing, fowling, sustenance, and all the other uses of the water and its products, (a few things which belonged to the king in his private right, and for his own use only excepted) are common to all the people, and that each has a right to use them according to his pleasure, 'subject only to the laws which regulate that use; that the property indeed vests in the sovereign, but it vests in him for the sake of' order and protection, and not for'his own use, but for the use of the citizen; in the same sense in which he holds all the public property and the domains of the crown, that the proceeds thereof may be collected into the' public treasury, and •applied to the public benefit and the public defence, and that he may have the direct, immediate, uncontrolled enjoyment of them. I am of opinion that this great principle of common law, in process of time, was gradually encroached upop and broken down ; that the powerful barons, in some'instances, appropriated to themselves tiiose common® rights; that tlm *15kings also, in some instances during* the same period, granted them out to their courtiers and favorites; and that these-seizures and these royal favors are the ground of all the several fisheries in England, now claimed either by proscription or grant; that the great charter, as it is commonly called, which was nothing but a restoration of common law rights, though it did not annul what had been thus tortiously done, yet restored again the principles of the common law in this, as well as in many other respects; and that since that time no king of England has had-the power of granting away those common rights, and thereby depriving the people of the enjoyment of them. I am of opinion that when Charles II. took possession of this country, by his right of discovery, he took possession of it in his sovereign capacity ; that he had the same right in it, and the same power over it, as he had in and over his other dominions, and no more; that this right consisted in granting the soil to private persons, for the purposes of settlement and colonization, of establishing a government, of supporting a governor, of conveying to him ail those things appurtenant to the sovereignty, commonly called royalties, for the benefit of the colonists, who came over hero clothed with all the essential rights and privileges secured to the subject by the British constitution; but that he could not, nor never did, so grant them as to convert them into private property; that those royalties, therefore, of which those rivers, ports, bays and coasts were part, by the grant of King Charles, passed to the duke of York, as the governor of the province, exercising the royal authority, for the public benefit, and not as the proprietor of the soil, and for his own use; that they passed from the duke of York to his grantees, and upon the surrender of the government, and as appurtenant thereto, and inseparable therefrom, reverted to the crown of England. And I am of opinion further, that, upon the Revolution, all those royal rights vested in the people of New Jersey, as *16the sovereign of the country, and are now in their hands; and that they, having themselves both the legal estate and the usufruct, may make such disposition of them, and such regulation concerning them, as they may think fit; that' this power of disposition and regulation can be exercised only by the legislative body, who are the representatives of the people for this purpose; that in the exercise thereof they may lawfully bank off the water of those rivers, ports and bays, and reclaim the land upon the shores; they may build dams, locks and bridges, for the improvement of the navigation and the ease of passage; they may clear out and improve fishing places to increase the product of the fishery; they may create, improve and enlarge oyster beds, by planting oysters thereon, in order to procure a more ample supply; they may do all this themselves, at the public expense, or they may athorize others to do it by their own labor, and at their own cost, giving them reasonable tolls, rents, profits or exclusive enjoyments; but that they cannot make a direct and absolute grant, divesting all the citizens of their common right; áuch a grant, or a law authorizing such a grant, would be contrary to the great principles of our constitution, and never could be borne by a free people. These principles I take to.be capable of the clearest demonstration. The proprietors, except in a few instances, made probably for the sake of experiment only, have, in their practice, recognized those principles, and the people have uniformly and uninterruptedly enjoyed the corresponding rights, from the 'first settlement of the colony down to this day, subject only to such regulation and such restraint as the legislature has thought just and right. From this short statement, it is seen that, in my opinion, the proprietors, as such, never had, since the surrender of the government, any right to, interest in, or power over, those waters, or the land covered by them; and that, therefore, the grant in question is void, and cannot prevail for the benefit of the plaintiff. And, upon this view of the subject, I am constrained to say ■ *17The plaintiff must be called. Upon the coming in of the Postea, the plaintiff’s counsel obtained a rule to shew cause why the non-suit should not be set aside and a new trial granted. This motion was argued in May term, 1821. Wall in support of the motion. This action is brought for a trespass for entering on the plaintiff’s soil, and taking and carrying away a quantity of oysters claimed to be his. It appears, by the evidence, that the plaintiff claims title under : 1. A grant from the proprietors, dated' 20th Janu- ary, 1685, to one Sonmans, bounding him on the Raritan river; and the subsequent grants under Sonmans, bounding on low water mark. 2. Under a grant from the proprietors, dated 10th April, 1818, including, by metes and bounds, the very place on which the trespass was proved to have been committed. 3. From the act of planting the oysters in question, by his own care and industry. At th,e trial of this cause before the Middlesex Circuit, in December, 1819, the plaintiff was non-suited by order of his Honor the Chief Justice, and the object of the present application is, to set aside the non-suit and obtain a new trial. In the discussion of this application, I do not consider it necessary to spend any time in directing the attention of the court to the language of the grants under which the plaintiff claims, nor to the effect, or diversity, between the two grants, the one bounding on the river, and the other 'ex vi lermini, including the very locus in question. Assuming, what appears to mo altogether incapable of being denied, that if soil covered with water is capable of grant, then that the plaintiff in this case, under one or both of his titles, may well claim the locus. *18Passing by, then for the present, all examination of the evidence, respecting which there is little or no dispute, I shall contend, that the non-suit in this case ought to be set aside, and a new trial awarded. 1. Because the plaintiff had a right of several fishery in this oystery, either for — 1. Floating fish, or general, exclusive, and several fishery. 2. Or a right to a local fishery. 2. Because, by purchasing or gathering the oysters', depositing them on the premises, and staking them out, he acquired such a right to them as would entitle him to an .action against any person who should take them without his leave. 1. In endeavoring to establish the first proposition, it will-be necessary to investigate — 1. The right of property to the soil of navigable rivers at common law, and to inquire, whether it was the subject of grant. 2.. The right of property to the soil of navigable rivers in New Jersey, and whether it is the subject of grant. 3. Whether by the grant of the soil of navigable rivers the right of several fishery passes, as inseparable. 1. The great principle of the common law of England is, to assign an owner to every thing capable of ownership, and whatever hath no other owner is vested by law in the king. 1 Black. 298-9 ; 2 Black. 15, 261-2. By the English law; or constitution, all land is supposed to have been the property of the king, at some time, and to be held mediately or immediately of him. 6 Com. Dig. 60 (D 63). This is said to be derived from the feudal system. 1 Black. 264. The common law has also assigned the ownership of navigable rivers, of arms of the sea, and even of the mare clausum, to the king. The king hath the sole interest^ in the soil of navigable rivers, and in the fisheries thereof. Davies 155. The king has the property tarn aquce, quam-scili, and all profits in'the sea, and all navigable rivers. 5 Com. Dig. 102 (A, B). The king, is the owner of the sea and soil. Har. L. T. 10, 11, *1914, 17, 18; 5 Coke, Constable’s case 107; 7 Coke 18; 2 Black. 261. The sea is the proper inheritance of the king. Davies 152. This doctrine of the common law is in perfect accordance with the law of nature and of nations. Every nation, by the law of nature and of nations, is the proprietor of the rivers, as well as soil, within its territorial limits. 1 Rutherf. 91, sec. 111 Vattel. 120, sec. 266. By the same law, the sea itself, to a certain extent and for certain purposes, may bo appropriated and become exclusive property, as well as the land. Vattel 127, see. 287 ; ib. 125, sec. 278. Whether the soil and rivers thus belonging to a nation, or any and what part of it shall be enjoyed in common by all her citizens, or whether it shall be appropriated to the exclusive use of individuals ? and if so appropriated, by whom such appropriation shall be made ? are questions which depend on the will of the nation herself, as declared in her constitution and laws. The nation being the sole mistress of the property in her possession, may dispose of it as she thinks proper. Vattel 116, sec. 257. She may dispose of what is common to all the citizens. Ib. 116, sec. 258. Or she may confer the right on the sovereign, Ib. 117, see. 251. In that case, he becomes the organ of the nation, Ib. 118, see. 262. By the English law, or constitution, the right of disposing of the public domains is vested exclusively in the king; and he had, until long after the reign of Charles II. the right of alienating them for ever. 1 Black. 286; 3 Cruise 14, sec. 5; ib. 565, sec. 16. He may also grant the soil of navigable rivers; and he may grant a free fishery without the soil. Har. L. T. 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 32, 33, 34, 56; 6 Com. Dig. 60 (D 611); 4 Bur. 2163; Davies 150. These authorities also prove that a subject may prescribe for a free or several fishery in navigable rivers and arms of the sea. A prescription cannot be for what may not be granted. 2 Black. 265; 7 Coke 18. *20From these authorities, it abundantly appears, that, by the principles of the common law, a subject may have a right of soil, and also a right of fishery, in navigable rivers' and arms of the sea, by grant or prescription. Ho case of pure unmixed common law origin can be produced against these positions. The case in Bracton is evidently borrowed from the civil law, and he quotes the very language of the Justinian code. In Davies 150, it is expressly denied to be the doctrine of the common law. This case, in Davies, is also, recognized as good authority by Justice Yates, in 4Bur. 2165, and by Chief Justice Kent, in 3 Caines 318. And Lord Hale’s treatise, in Har. L. T. who lays down the law in accordance with Davies, is cited with approbation, and recognized as sound law by Chief Justice Spencer. 17 John. 209. Indeed, nothing can be more variant than the civil and comnion law on the subject of aquatic and riparian rights. By the civil law, every citizen has the right to use the land of another, on the banks of navigable rivers, for towing. The common law denies that right. 3 Term Rep. 253 ; 17 John. 209. The grant from King Charles II. to William Penn, of our sister State of Pennsylvania, grants the soil, and rivers, and fisheries within its limits. Chief Justice Tilghman (2 Bin. 476) expressly holds, that by this grant he became entitled to the fisheries. And a similar principle is recognized, (4 Mass. 140; 17 John. 203) as to the right of the people to grant, by express words. Even in England, then it may be fairly concluded, from a careful examination- of the cases cited, that the king could lawfully grant the soil of navigable, rivers and arms of the sea to a subject, and that it might be held either by grant or prescription, which always presupposes a grant. ■ 2. Could the king grant the right of soil to the navigable rivers in New Jersey, and did he grant it? This opens a. singular discussion, at this day, in.New Jersey, when it is a fact, proved in the deduction of all the ‘titles in New Jersey, *21that he did grant the lands; and that every foot of land now held by a freeman in New Jersey is traced up to the grant of the king. What had become more fiction in England is an undisputed fact here. All lands in New Jersey were held immediately of the king. He granted this, as well as all the other colonies, as whim, caprice, favor or avarice dictated. They were considered as his private domains, and were held and granted as such. This doctrine is not varied by proving, that tho king became entitled to tho lands and rivers in this, then howling wilderness, in virtue of his prerogative; that he held them jura corona}. If so, still, by the law of England, he was the organ of the nation to alienate them; and admitting, (what is altogether denied) that by the conquest, or discovery, of this country, the people of England became entitled to a common right of fishery in the navigable rivers, arms of the sea, and seas of this extensive territory, yet it has been already proved, that, by the common law of England, as well as the law of nature and nations, the king, as the organ of the nation, might grant them in propriety to an individual, and thus destroy the right of tho people; and that his grant would be binding on the people. It is of no importance, as to the validity or effect of the grant he did make, whether he derived his title to this country from discovery or conquest. In either case, it vested in him in absolute propriety, and, by the laws and constitution of England, he was authorized to alienate it, as he saw proper, without reference to the good of the people, or the will of parliament. Ho would have had this right on the general principles of national law. Vat. 101, sec. 210. His grants, even of the common rights of his subjects, would be binding on them; and, if so, how much more binding will it be on those who come in under the very grant, and have recognized it. It is to be remembered, that this is not a question between the people of England, claiming that their agent or organ had exceeded his powers, but it is a question raised by those who *22derive their right to the soil, and, of course, to the participation of the rights founded on it under the very grant which is now sought to be circumscribed or destroyed. It is a matter not clearly settled, how the king acquired .his right to this country. Blackstone, 1 Com. 108, supposes that he obtained it by treaties, or the right of conquest. Smith, in his Hist, of N. J. 8, insists that it was acquired by the right of discovery. The right, however derived, was strengthened by the purchase of the Indian title, which was-made by the proprietors. The king of England very early exercised the right of granting this country. In 1606, King-James I. granted this province, together with Virginia, &c., by patent, to Sir Thomas Gates and others. Smith’s Hist.. N. J. 17. This patent was repealed in 1623. It remained in the crown until March 12, 1664, when King Charles II. granted it to his brother, the duke of York. Smith’s Hist. N. J. 59. On June 24, 1664, the duke of York granted it to Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkley. At the date of this grant, the eastern part of New Jersey was in possession of the Dutch, who had made considerable settlements in Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset. In August, 1664, before the last mentioned grants were-known here,'Colonel Nicholls, the royal governor of New York, conquered it, together, with the fort on the Delaware, at Newcastle, from the Dutch. Smith, in his Hist. N. York 29, 30, 31, says, it was re-conquered by the Dutch, in 1673, and given up by the peace of 1674. This is somewhat doubtful. Captain Philip Carteret, the first proprietary governor, with the first settlers under Carteret"" and Berkley, arrived in New Jersey in the summer of 1665, and, by the treaty of Breda, in 1667, New Jersey was formally ceded, by the Dutch, toJhe king of England. This gave rise to the subsequent grant, made on .the '29th July, 1674, by the king to the duke of York, and by the duke to Berkley and Carteret. Leamning & Spicer 41 to 50. Smith’s Hist. N. York 32. This grant is to receive a liberal con*23struction in favor of the grantees. It contains the words “certain knowledge,” “mere motion,” and “special grace,” and it purports to be made for a valuable consideration. 3 Cruise, 567, sec. 11, 12. The words of the grant, also, are very broad and comprehensive — ’“All the lands, islands, soils, rivers, harbors, waters, fishings, &c.” Leaming & Spicer 4. These words are technically apt to pass, as well the soil of the rivers as the fisheries. 2 Black. 18; Har. L. T. 18, 33; Dav. 150; 5 Com. Dig. (D 290). It is abundantly manifest from the cotemporaneous history of England, that this grant and charter, as well as all other grants and charters of the American provinces, were framed with great deliberation; were submitted to tho law officers of the crown, and every word well weighed and understood. By looking at other grants, it will appear that when the king meant to reserve the right of fishery he did it by express words. It is-so in the grant of Maryland to Lord Baltimore. 1 Har. & M’Hen. 564. These charters and grants are groat state papers ; and considering them as such, and referring to tho situation of England at the time, this idea is strengthened. The policy of the crown, as well as that of tho English nation at that time, was to people America as rapidly as possible. It is obvious that these grants of immense territories were designed not1’ merely for the benefit of favorites, but to foster, promote and encourage the settlement of tho country. Hence, the king not only granted the territory in the most ample and comprehensive terms, so as not onfy to divest himself and the people of England of all propriety in the soil and rivers, but also the right of sovereignty and of self-government, unrestricted in all particulars, so that they be not contrary to the laws of England, but, as near as may be, conformable thereto. At this time it was well known that much discontent prevailed in England among those who considered themselves persecuted for their religious opinions; and the spirit of liberty, which had destroyed the sceptre of Charles I. and *24brought hjm to the block, was not -wholly extinguished by the restoration of his son. There were still many gallant and patriotic Englishmen who cherished the sacred flame of liberty, and _ who viewed the prerogative of the crown, in the hands of the Stuart dynasty, as dangerous to the rights of the people; and who detested the licentious and tyrannical conduct of one brother, and dreaded the religious bigotry of the other. Admonished by the fate of their father, these royal brothers might wish to avoid it, and instead of repressing the spirit of emigration which had then seized those who were remarkable for boldness, enterprise, and attachment to civil and religious liberty, they might have had the wisdom to hold out inducements to the Hampdens and Cromwells, if any still remained, to seek their fortunes in the wilds of America and there create new theatres for action. The grant to the duke of York (Leaming & Spieer 6) not only contains the most ample cession of the domain and'sovereignty of the.country, but gives him the right of interdicting any persons from settling that he may see proper. The grant from the duke to Berkley and Carteret is as full and ample as the grant to him, except as to territorial limits. There- can be no question that at that period no one in England seriously supposed that this grant violated the rights of the subject, or transcended the prerogative of the king. It was not supposed that a subject of England, as such, could claim a right in New Jersey, hostile to the grant made by the king. ■ Could he have set up the pretences of the adverse counsel, that the king held the colony merely as trustee for the people, and that a grjant made to an individual without consideration, and for favoritism, was void ? Could he have set up the common right of fishery, as an unalienable right, vested in the king for great public purposes ? and, as one. of the people of England, made good his claim to the waters of this wilderness ? The very laws upon which his claim must be based had already sanctioned *25the cession and grant of this country.to individuals. It was no longer the property of the nation; their lawful agent had alienated it. It is manifest that our ancestors, who, I may venture • to assert, felt as ardent a love of liberty, and understood their rights as Englishmen, as well, at least, as many who prate about the rights of the people, and common right, and other imposing .terms, had no such opinion. These men, whose love of civil and religious liberty led them to abandon the delights of civilized life, the tombs of their ancestors, and all those endearing ties which bind man to the place of his birth to encounter the privations, hardships and dangers of settling a wilderness, peopled only by savages, knew well the rights, the powers and privileges of the proprietors, under these grants. Before crossing the Atlantic, they ascertain the terms upon which they will be permitted to settle under the proprietors. The grants and concessions, dated 10th February, 1664, is the Magna Charta of New Jersey, and therein the settlers stipulate for a representative government; a free passage to or through any seas; lands for wharves, keys, harbors, fe., and that they shall not be liable for trespasses on 'loaste lands. Smith’s Hist. N. J. 163. Leaming & Spicer 20, 25, secs. 3, 6, 8. In 1682, the colonial legislature resolved, that the government, and law's of New Jersey were purchased together. Smith's Hist. N. J. 163. In 1683, they published their fundamental rights; (ib. 153) and, in 1698, they republished them, containing a proviso, that nothing therein contained should infringe any grant or charter already granted. The first settlers made their own terms, and when wre find them treating for the right of navigation, and of harbors, &c., which are part of the jus publicum, upon the principles of all laws, and securing them by contract, and silent as to the right of fishery, it furnishes a strong argument in favor of our position, the more *26especially, as their brethren of West Jersey, deriving under, the same grant, actually stipulate for the right of common .fishery. Leaming & Spicer 390. • In 1676, Lord Berkley sold his moiety of New Jersey; ' and in 1682 the executors of Sir George Carteret sold his moiety. In 1685, the duke of York, to whom the grant had been made, became king. At that time, the province, having passed out of the possessiori of the courtiers and favorites, and increased very rapidly in population and wealth, became an object of jealousy to the government at home, and many pretexts were used to resume the government. Smith’s Mist. N. J. 65. It is to be remarked, however, that even then it was never suggested, by those ' who were fertile in devices to. avoid charters and patents, that the king had .transcended his prerogative in making the grant. It was then pretended by the adherents of the crown, as our adversaries now argue, (and indeed it is the main pillar of their argument,) that the right of government, although lawfully conveyed to the duke of York, could not be alienated by him or his alienees. Smith’s Mist. N. J. 570. Then that doctrine was supposed to partake of the arbitrary nature of the Stuart prerogative, and to be hostile to the interests of the people. Hence it was resisted by the people then inhabiting here, and gave rise to the resolutions of 1682, 1683 and 1698, already quoted, in which the rights of the proprietors are distinctly asserted. It is a singular position, that our ancestors coming here under an express recognition of the rights of the proprietors under the grant to the duke of York, and purchasing part of the very lands passed thereby, could destroy or circumscribe the rights of those under whom they held. It would be analogous to a tenant denying the right of his landlord. 3. Having established, as is submitted, that on the principles of the common law the king could grant the soils, rivers, lands and fisheries within New Jersey, and that, by express words, he did grant them to those under whom the *27proprietors claim title, it remains to shew, that as owners of the rivers and soils, independent of the grant of the fishings, the proprietors became entitled to a several fishery. Fresh waters belong, in propriety, to the owners of the soil on each side. Har. L. T. 5, 7; 2 Black. 261; Dav. 152; 4 Bur. 2162. This doctrine is recognized by Chief Justice Kent, in 3 Caines 319, and by Chief Justice Spencer, in 17 John. 209. . In these rivers, the right of fishing is annexed to the soil, and passes by a grant of it, and is recovered by the description of land covered with water. Har. L. T. 5, 7. The distinction in the books between saltwater rivers, navigable rivers, and rivers in which the tide ebbs and flows, and fresh water rivers not navigable rivers, and rivers in which the tide does not ebb and flow, for they are different expressions for the same thing, is local, and arises altogether from the nature of the rivers in England. There all their rivers, so far as the tide ebbs and flows, are salt, and so far navigable; and those in which the tide does not ebb and flow are fresh, and not navigable. 2 Con. Rep. 4; 2 Bin. 476. That is not so here. The Delaware, Susquehanna, Schuylkill, &c., and in fact all our great rivers, are navigable beyond the influence of the tide and the salt waters. The doctrine there was founded on the nature, extent and situation of their rivers, and adapted to it; and the grant of lands on salt water rivers, bounding on the river, carried only to-low water mark. In fresh water rivers, the same words in a grant would carry to the filum aquce. This was the rule of construction. But even in salt water rivers, the grant, by the king, of the soil, &c., conveyed also the right of fishery as an incident. In this sense is to be understood Har. L. T. 11, 15; 4 Bur. 2163 ; 3 Jac. L. D. 82. If the distinction in the English books on this subject is local, it may be questioned whether it applies here. Our ancestors, on emigrating, did not bring with them the whole body of the common law, as well that establishing general principles *28•applicable to a new country, as tkat founded on the peculiar state of the country from which they came. They brought t*ke common law purified from its local dross. Every thing of a mere local origin was left on the other side of the ocean, and we have gradually substituted in its place a local common law of our own. Our ancestors brought the folk law merely, as contradistinguished from the jus corona and the local common law of England. Besides, they settled this country under royal charters defining their rights, or under grants made to individuals, which, in many respects, varied from the principles of the common law, as in this very grant of New Jersey the king parted with many of his prerogative rights as to harbors, ports, rivers, &c. By the grant of the soil of a navigable river, on the admitted principles of the common law, a right of several fishery passes. Har. L. T. 5, 7, 15, 33, 34; 2 Black. 394 Bur. 2163; 5 Com. Dig. Pischary. A right of several fishery is in concomitance with, and founded on, the right of soil, and is co-extensive with it; and whoever has the right of soil in a navigable water has, also, the right of several fishery. Under the grant from the proprietors, offered in evidence, the plaintiff acquired a right of several fishery generally, and without limitation, co-extensive with his right of soil. 2. But if he did not acquire a right of several fishery for floating fish, he acquired a right to erect a local fishery or an oystery, within the limits of his grant, and was entitled ¡to recover for an infringement of that right. Har. L. T. 18 to 23; 4 Mass. 527. This doctrine is supported by decisions in our sister states. 1 Swift. 341-2; 4 Mass. 527; 10 Mass. 210; 2 Bin. 475. The right of several fishery exists in New Jersey, in the Delaware and other navigable' streams, and this right has been sanctioned by a decision of Chief Justice Kinsey, at the Gloucester Circuit. It is recognized and protected by various acts of the legislature. The fisheries are taxed as *29private property, distinct from the land, and above a hundred are now enjoyed on the Delaware. It- also exists in-Pennsylvania, on the shores of Staten Island, in Virginia, Maryland, &c. This proves that there is a geneSd local common law on this subject, pervading all the states where the waters afford sufficient inducements for the owners of the banks to erect fisheries. Whenever the soil of a river is granted by express terms,, or even constructively, it becomes, so far as regards the right of fishery, a private river, and the principles of the-common law, as to private or fresh water rivers, attach. Whenever the soil of a river passes, by grant or otherwise, out of the hands of the sovereign of the country, it becomes, ipso facto, a private river and the subject of a several fishery. How can rights, which are merely accessary, exist in the hands of the sovereign after he has parted with the-principal! Several fishery is an incident to the soil; while it remains the property of the people the common law right of free and common fishery continues ; but when the soil is sold or conveyed, the incident also passes. 1 Rutherf. 92. This doctrine is expressly asserted by the commissioners appointed by this state to treat with New York respecting our eastern boundary. They wore appointed by the legislature ; reported their proceedings to the legislature; and the legislature, by publishing their report at the public expense, and without comment, have adopted their reasoning ; and it becomes, as well from that circumstance as from the great learning and talents of the commissioners themselves, entitled to very great weight in our tribunals. ‘ It fully supports this proposition. Report of Commissioners 15. The proprietors, also, from a very early period down to the present time, have been in the practice of granting the soil of navigable rivers. On the trial, many such grants were shewn, and they, at least, prove a eotemporaneous construction of the grant under which they held. While thé rivers remain in the hands of *30the sovereignty of the country, the right of fishery therein is public and common; when it is granted to an individual, it becomes a several fishery. This is consistent with the doctrine of the natural law, as laid down in Rutherf. 91. The jus publicum in all rivers is the same. The jus publicum is. the right of navigation; the right of making laws for the conservation of fish and their ,fry; and to regulate the mode and right of taking them. Har. L. T. 22, 23, 36. Lord Hale nowhere considers the right of fishery as a part of the jus publicum, properly so called. This doctrine perfectly harmonizes private rights with public rights. It will here be necessary to anticipate some of the arguments of the counsel of the defendant, that they may be apprized of the answers that will be relied on. 1. It has been contended, and no doubt will be again, that the right of fishery is a royal franchise which the king holds for great public purposes, in trust for the benefit of the people, and cannot, from its very .nature, be conveyed. The fallacy of this position consists in not distinguishing between the different kinds of fisheries. Fisheries are—1. Several. 2. Free. And 3. Common. 2. Black. 39. 1. The right of several fishery, as already shewn, is founded on, and annexed to, the soil, and is by reason of, and in concomitance with, the ownership of the soil. When the soil -of a navigable river is granted the right of several fishery therein begins. 2. A free fishery is altogether different; it is a royal franchise, distinct from the land and founded on grant or prescription. By the grant of a free fishery, the right of fishery only passes, the right of soil remains in the king. 2 Cruise 297, sec. 70; 5 Com. Dig. 290. A free fishery separate from the soil, appropriating noffthe land but the fishery, might, on sound principles of policy, be prohibited in every well regulated government. If permitted, every part of the British channel might have been parcelled out among courtiers and favorites, and thus the ocean itself made tributary to the avarice of man. The right of several *31fishery, however, springing from, and connected with, the possession of the soil, stood on wholly different grounds. It gave an incentive to industry, and would benefit the public. The sound rational principle on which the distinction between the ownership of rivers navigable and not navigable rests, is, that, as to the latter, a subject must be the owner of it, and may be of the former, but prima facie it is in the king, and, until granted, he holds it as the agent of the people and for their benefit; and it is public and subject to — 3. The right of common of fishery. But this right of common of fishery continues only while the soil remains in the public. But there are not wanting authorities, among those already cited, to prove that the king may grant a free fishery. But the position now contended for is, that the authorities which deny the right of the king to grant a fishery in navigable waters, when properly understood, apply only to free fisheries, which is a royal franchise, and not to several fisheries. This distinction reconciles all the seeming contradictions in the books. 2. That the king was prohibited by Magna Charla from granting a fishery. The 16th and 23d ch. of Magna Charla are relied on to support this position. Ch. 17th is expressly stated by the Mirror to be obsolete. 3 Cruise 297; 1 Cok. Inst. 30, 37; 5 Jac. L. D. 4. This section is considered by Lord Hale (Mar. L. T. 7, 8, 9) as designed to take away the right of the king in private rivers, an interest of pleasure or recreation, which ho enjoyed by the writ de defendone riparias, that is, to put the rivers in defenso, to bar fishing or fowling till the king had taken his pleasure. And that the 23d ch. applies to weirs, kidells, and obstructions. Mar. L. T. 9, 22. This exposition agrees much better with the character of Magna Charla than Blackstoue’s. Magna Charta proceeded from a struggle between the barons, bold, turbulent, rapacious and oppressive, and kings, weak, timid and tyrannical. Let us not be the slaves of mere words. Whatever benefit *32has accrued to the liberties of the world from Magna Charta, has arisen more from chance than design. The barons armed themselves, not to support the rights of the people, but to protect their own usurpations upon the rights of both monarch and people, and in the collision between the two oppressors, some, principles of liberty were struck out. It was a mere streamlet, issuing, as if by a miracle, from the rock of tyx'anny, struck not by the arm of inspired patriotism, but by a casual blow of the sword of the xnailed baron, in -the attempt to deck himself in the robes of royalty. But these chapters of Magna Charta are mere statutes, and it is held in Westminster Hall, that none of the .statutes of England, as such, applied to the colonies. 1 Salk. 666; 2 Ld. Ray. 1274. We hold not our liberties in this state by the provisions of Magna Charta. Every freeman, wherever his lot may be cast, will turn to that instrument with pride and satisfaction, as a noble but rude and incomplete monument of the liberties of man. It is the corner-stone of the liberties of Englishmen, and the first landmark in tracing out the liberties of the subject after the Norman usurpation. But the history of liberty in this state is happily not lost in the recess of time. It is to be found in the grant from the king to the duke of Yoi'k, and the grants and concessions between the proprietors and the settlers, and the bill of fundamental rights. Our ancestors stipulated for their own rights, and built up a great system of republican liberty, based on the natural rights of man and protected by representative government, in which they have interwoven all the essential principles of civil and religious liberty; I turn to it with pride and pleasure. Leaming & Spicer 162-3, secs. 16, 19. Beside it, the much boasted Magna Charta of England dwindles to ,a twinkling star in the galaxy of freedom. It embodies every thing worthy of preservation in Magna Charta, and was the most perfect system of civil and l-eligious liberty .existing in the world at that period. *33It is the foundation of our present republican system, lopped of the overshadowing branches of royalty, but the trunk remains entire and vigorous. On it has been engrafted, the sovereignty of the people, equal laws and equal rights, and, to this day, the graft is nurtured by the sap and life-blood of the parent stock. These form the Magna Charta of New Jersey. To trace our liberties to Magna Charta may indeed gratify a feeling akin to that of pride of ancestry, but it is wholly deceptive. In all the struggles between the people and the proprietors, on the one side, and the court party, on the other, during the proprietary government, and after the surrender, between the people and the royal governors, it will be found that the patriots of the day constantly refer to the grants and concessions, and the fundamentals, as the basis of' their rights. Leaming & Spicer, passim. Indeed, the collection of the original documents, so often referred to, made by Leaming & Spicer, was occasioned by the desire of the legisla turo to rescue from oblivion documents so essential to their just rights and liberties. Besides, these chapters of Magna Charta are, on the face of them, local and confined to England, and cannot, in fair reasoning, be extended to the rivers in America. With the same propriety it might be insisted, that the provisions contained in Magna Charta respecting game, forests, &c., were applicable. The legislature of New Jersey, at a very early period, enacted similar laws respecting the obstruction of navigable waters. Paterson 15. 3. That, by the surrender made by the proprietors to Queen Anne, on April 15, 1702, the right of fishery in the navigable waters of New Jersey, which, if it passed to the ""proprietors at all, passed as an incident to sovereignty, became re-annexed to the crown. If the former propositions contended for are supported, there is no force in this argument ; because, if the king had a right to grant soil covered with water, and fisheries, and did grant them, they became severed from the sovereignty, and could not be re-annexed *34but by terms as broad and comprehensive as those by which they were granted. In the grant, the water, soil, and fisheries are passed in express terms, and not constructively or as incident to the sovereignty, and it cannot be gravely pretended that it varies it, because they were conveyed by the same instrument. This argument is a petitio prineipii ; it assumes the very point in debate, and which is denied by us. A reference to the memorial of the proprietors, which preceded the surrender, and the surrender itself completely dispels this idea. In the memorial, the proprietors expressly separate the idea of government and property. Leaming & Spicer 607. They surrender merely the powers of government. Ib. 613-4. It was accepted as such. Ib. 617. By their memorial, the proprietors, previous to the surrender, stipulate for the soils and lands of the provinces and the quit rents, (ib. 589, sec. 1)-which is granted. Ib. 594. That the twenty-four proprietors may be lords of the soil &a., (ib. 590, sec. 9) which was granted. Ib. 595. That all lands, goods, and chattels of traitors, felons, deodands, fugitives, and persons outlawed, waifs, estrays, treasure-trove, mines and minerals, royal mines, wrecks, royal fish that shall be found or taken within East Jersey, or by the inhabitants thereof within the seas adjacent, to remain to the proprietors, with all the other privileges and advantages, as amply as in the grant and confirmation of March 14, 1682. Ib. 590, sec. 13. The lords of the council of trade and foreign plantations, who had the assistance of all the great law officers of the crown, in answer say, that this may be reasonable, except as to the goods and chattels of traitors, which are matters of state; nor can right accruing to the proprietors from the seas adjacent be well circumscribed &c. Ib. 596. This memorial, and the answer and surrender, are. to be considered as a treaty between the proprietors and the queen, and are to be taken in pari materia. The proprietors knew that they held the right to treasure-trove, royal fish, &c., as incident to the grant of sovereignty, (1 Black. 299) and, *35unless provided for by express stipulation, it would again vest in the crown on the surrender of the sovereignty. The lords to whom the memorial was addressed, admit that the right of the proprietors to the seas adjacent could not be well circumscribed, so far as they passed by the king’s grant, "" westward of Long Island, bounded on the east by the main sea, and hath on the west Delaware bay or river,, and extending southward to the main ocean, as far as Gape May, at the mouth of Delaware bay.” Leaming & Spicer 10. So far, then, as these limits extended the proprietors remained lords of the soil, and their rights could not be well circumscribed, is the strong lauguage of the lords of the council of trade and foreign plantations, and may he considered as the opinion of the great law officers of the crown, as they were constantly applied to by the board of trade in all important matters. But the proprietors, as sovereigns, by the law of nations and of England, were proprietors of the sea to the extent of three leagues from the shore, and as such, lords of the soil covered with water. But this right they held as sovereigns, not as lords of the soil, and when they surrendered the sovereignty it passed to the crown. By the declaration of independence, this right vested in the people of New Jersey; previous to the surrender, the right of granting a free fishery within this three leagues was in the proprietors; after the surrender, and until the declaration of independence, in the crown ; and since, in the people of New Jersey. No grant of a free fishery has ever been made within these waters, and none can now be made but by the legislature of New Jersey. That they have the right so to do, upon the principles of the common law, I think has been already shewn. The right of the proprietors, as to the soil, and everything else that passes by the grant to the duke of York, untouched by the surrender, was not affected by the revolution. That glorious event found them lords of the soil, and it left them such. It was not intended to take away, but to secure rights. *362. But even if the court should be of opinion that the soil of the rivers below low water mark and the right of several fishery were not capable of being granted, yet we contend that the plaintiff, by gathering, or purchasing and planting the oysters upon land which he claimed, and bestowing his own labor upon them, and staking them off, thereby shewing that he did not throw them into the water to abandon them, acquired a right therein which is protected by law, and will enable him to maintain an action against any one who disturbed him in the enjoyment, thereof. He acquired such right upon the principles of the natural law; (1 Rutherf. 91) upon the principles of the civil law; (Vattel 114, secs. 250-1; Domat. 475, secs. 3, 4, 7, 9; 280, secs. 24, 27, 28, 29) upon the principles of the common law; (2 Black, 8, 9, 391, 392, 402; 3 Chitty’s C. L. 359; 5 Esp. R. 62; 1 Camp. 309) and by the law of Hew Jersey, 1 Pennington 397. The oysters belonged to him before they were planted; and placing them in a navigable water congenial to their growth and sustenance, accompanied with every indicia of ownership, cannot be considered as divesting him of any rights previously vested.- The oyster is a fixture,, and will not remove from the place where it is deposited. If a whale is captured and left within the tide waters no-man has a right to take possession of it. So, if floating fish are caught and placed in a car. So, also, of a piece of timber secured by being drifted off by the tide; the right of the original owner remains. Eyery man may deposit his goods in the highway. He may thereby subject himself to-an action or indictment for a nuisance, but he does not lose his right of property. In no case does a man lose a right of property vested in him by the principles of law, by placing it in a public highway, or a navigable water subject to the jus publicum. Upon these principles, it is respectfully submitted, that the non-suit ought to be get aside, and a new trial awarded» *37 Wood, in answer. — The main question in the present case is, whether the proprietors have a right to grant a several fishery in a navigable river, to the exclusion of the right of common fishery in the citizens generally ? The right of the citizens has always been used, and the court must see their way clear before they will attempt to deprive them of it. We contend that the right of the soil in navigable rivers, and the sea at the distance of three leagues from the shore, and the right of jurisdiction therein, with the exclusive right to what are called royal fish, are vested in the state, the sovereign power, as a part of the prerogative of the sovereign power; and that the citizens have a common vested right of fishery therein ; and secondly, that if the above rights, ascribed to the state, be in the proprietors, they hold them subject to the common right of fishery of the citizens at large, of which they cannot deprive tiiem. In establishing these propositions, it will be necessary to consider, what are the rights of the king of England, in relation to these subjects. By virtue of his prerogative, he has the allodium of the soil in navigable rivers and the sea, as above mentioned, with an exclusive right to royal fish. Iiis subjects have a common of piscary therein, which is a vested legal right, and may be pleaded. These rights of the king are part of the public domains, vested in him for public purposes. The king cannot transfer them to a private individual for a private purpose, much less, by attempting to do so, can he destroy the common right of fishery, the vested interest of the subject. This doctrine is not peculiar to the common law. It is the doctrine of the civil law, which is the basis of the codes of modern Europe, and which goes much farther. Coop. Justin. 67, 68, lib. 2, tit. 1, secs. 1, 2 3. Positions supporting this doctrine are frequently to be met with in treatises on national law. Vattel 11, book 1, chap. 3, sec. 34; 117, book 1, chap. 21, secs. 260, 261. These doctrines apply with more force to England. Their •government is a limited monarchy; their king is only a *38branch, and the executive-branch, of the sovereign power. Such a power in the king, as is contended for on the part of the plaintiff, which is in its nature legislative, is altogether heterogeneous and destructive of the harmony and order of the British constitution. Their parliament, alone, can have the right of transferring the public domains of the nation. The king may grant his private property, his ordinary revenue, lands vested in him upon -feudal principles, but not the public property. Magna Charta, with Lord Coke’s commentary upon it. 1 Reeves’ Hist. 234; Chitty on Fisheries ; 1 Esp. Dig. part 2, 270; 2 Black. Com. 39 ; Bac. Abr. tit. Prerogative, book 3; 3 Cru. 297; Willes 268 ; Warren v. Matthews, 6 Mod. 73. The king could not grant the temporalities of the church, which are in him, before the 18th, Edward III. 1 Black. Com. 282. The authorities cited by the plaintiff’s counsel to prove, that upon the principles of national law, the public waters may be appropriated, only prove that they may be appropriated by a nation, to the exclusion of others. They do not touch the question, whether a king may appropriate them to the exclusion of his subjects ? It is true the Norman kings usurped this power of transferring the public waters to private individuals, their favorites; but this power was restrained by Magna Charta, the great object of which was to restore Saxon liberty. Black. Tracts, Introduction to Magna Charta 289. The reason of allowing such grants of Magna Charta to prevail, as were made prior to the reign of John and in the reign - of Henry II. was no doubt because such rights were vested in the hands of innocent alienees, and the barons of those days were moderate in the work of reformation. Those grants made prior to Magna Charta, and allowed by it, are no doubt the foundation of- all the several fisheries and exclusive ownerships of navigable waters in England, which are now claimed by pre^ scription and proved by immemorial usage, which presupposes such original grant. Instances of abuse may have occurred since, which are now supported in that way. The *39caso in Dav. Rep. is a mere dictum of the judges, as to the law in Ireland, and in the worst times of English jurisprudence. The other authorities cited by the plaintiff’s counsel furnish cases of prescription only. But wo are told the king holds the public waters, not as a part of his prerogative, and unalienable, but as having the allodium of the soil of England on feudal principles. It is clear, however, that he holds by virtue of his prerogative. 2 Black Com. 39; 6 Com. Dig. tit. Prerogative 55, (D) 80. The queen of England is entitled to dower upon the demise of the king, and though an alien. 1 Black. Com. 223, 231. If navigable waters are not vested in him as the property of the nation, and under his prerogative, for public purposes, she would be entitled to dower in them. Free fishery is a franchise, or branch of the king’s prerogative. 2 Black Com. If the king did not hold the soil itself by virtue of his prerogative, a right granted out of it could not be considered a franchise. The feudal law was introduced by William the Conqueror. Admit that the Norman kings pretended to claim the sea and navigable rivers upon feudal principles, as their private property, yet the Saxon kings held it as a part of the prerogative; (Bac. Abr. Prerogative B. 3) and Magna Charta revived the Saxon doctrine and put an end to the Norman usurpation. If we were to admit that the kings of England, both before and since Magna Charta held the sea and navigable rivers as private transferable property; yet they held it subject to the common right of fishery, in the subject, which is a vested right, and may be pleaded. 1 Pen. Rep. 391; Post v. Mun, 1 South. 61; Richardson v. the Mayor of Oxford, 2 H. Black. 182; Har. L. T. 11, 19, 20; 4. Term Rep. 437. To destroy the vested legal right would be the highest effort of legislation. A king of England, upon the principles of the British constitution, cannot do it. In Eargrave it is admitted, that the king cannot, by alienation, destroy the jus publicum, and that *40the common right of fishery is a part of the jus publicum. When he tells us, then, that the king may, by alienation, destroy this common right of-fishery, it only proves that the author is inconsistent with himself. The construction put upon Magna Charta, in Hargrave, is opposed to all the authorities upon that subject above cited. It supposes the barons of Runnymede were anxious to put an end to royal encroachment, by prohibiting the subject from the right of fishing, and yet they left it in the power of the king to defeat their right at any time, and to any extent, by merely granting the soil -to his favorites, an impotent effort which was unworthy of them. Having ascertained the right and powers of the king over the navigable waters of England, it is easy to shew that he possessed the same rights and powers, and no others, over the public navigable waters of this country. England claimed North.America by right of prior discovery. The soil, on the principles of the British law and constitution, vested in the king, and for the purpose of beingparcelled out among his subjects. The English government could only hold it for the purpose of being settled. Vattel 99, book 1, chap. 18, secs. 207, 208. The people emigrating-under the'duke of York to'America, brought with them all the laws and rights of Englishmen, except such as were rendered inapplicable by the change of their local situation. 1 Bl. Com. 107. If the king had retained immediate dominion over this country, instead of granting it to the duke of York, he would have transferred the soil to the inhabitants, who, of course, would take the same rights and interests in the adjacent navigable waters as in England. His having owned all the soil, would give the king no greater power over the navigable waters. Suppose a manor in England, through which a navigable river flows, should revert to the king, and he should parcel it out again to his subjects, they would take the same rights as before in the navigable waters. *41It is said, the people migrating here brought with them political, but not municipal, rights ; and. that the provision on this subject, in Magna Charta, was merely local. On the contrary, they brought civil, as well as political, rights. Constitution of N. J. ; Smith’s Hist. N. J. 291; 8 Cranch 242; 1 Mass. T. R. 60, 61. Laws restraining the power of the king, more especially on navigable waters which supplied the inhabitants of a wilderness with food, were all important to them, and peculiarly applicable to their situation. But the king caused to be created proprietary governments here, by the grant to the duke of York. In the construction of this charter, we are to consider — 1. What the king had a right to grant; and — 2. What he intended to grant. 1. It is manifest he could give to the duke of York and his assigns, no greater right and power ■over the navigable waters here than he himself would have possessed; and, if the words of the grant are more extensive, all beyond his legitimate right is absolutely void. As he could only possess a right in these navigable waters, subject to the common right of fishery of the inhabitants, which was unalienable, the duke of York, and all claiming under him, would take the right of the king, subject to the same restriction ; but — 2. The king did not intend to grant to the duke and his assigns, as an individual, an exclusive right of fishery in these navigable waters. In the construction of this charter, we should consider it as a great state paper, not to be confined .within the petty trammels of a mere private conveyance. The grant is not made to him as an individual, but as a qualified sovereign, created so by the same instrument, and thereby vested with a qualified sovereignty over the country. He puts the duke in his place, with his powers, and to hold the territory for the same purposes that he held it; the soil to be parcelled out among emigrants; the navigable waters to be used by those emigrants for navigation and fishing. He, therefore, gives the duke the soil and rivers, and all royalties, with the *42 powers of government, to be exercised according to the laws and statutes of the realm of England. Admitting, for a moment, the abstract power of the king to make an exclusive grant of fishery to an individual, in navigable waters, yet, in the present case, he granted to the duke of- York, as-sovereign over them, to hold them as he held them, with a common right of fishery in the settlers. The grant of the duke to Berkley and Carteret, and the subsequent grants, will receive the same construction. Hence, the people here always exercised a common right of fishery. 1 Allinson's N. J. Laws 57, preamble; Leaming & Spicer, 368, 369, 371, 129, sec. 6. It is said, this was a conquered country : be it so. This would give the king no greater power over his British subjects ; he conquered with their arms. Vattel 391, book 3, chap. 13, sec. 202.. Smith’s Hist. N. J. 119. The country, however, was not conquered, but retaken from the Dutch. It is said, in the grant to Lord Baltimore, (1 Harris and M’Henry 564) there is an express reservation of the right of fishery to the inhabitants of England and Ireland. It. might have been doubted, whether the right of fishery would have extended to them, and was not confined to the-inhabitants of Maryland. But why was there no reservation in favor of the latter ? Hot, surely, because it was intended they should be deprived of it, but because, it was clear they would have had a right, without a reservation in their favor. The interference is clearly in our favor, notwithstanding the opinion of Mr. Dulaney. It is said, that all the ramparts of the people’s rights are to be found in the concessions and fundamental constitutions, and that in the disputes before the surrender to Queen Anne, the people always appealed to them. It is manifest those provisions were merely precautionary, intended to operate upon the local government. If Charles had intended a despotism here, his grantee and his successors would have pursued the plan. See Mr. Walsh’s Appeal, on that sub*43ject. These provisions would have been nugatory if they were not in pursuance of the original charter. They could not otherwise have bound the king, and, of course, would not have been appealed to. The duke of York and his successors, the proprietors, having held these navigable waters subject to the common right of the people, in the quality of limited sovereigns, vested with the prerogatives of the king> in the surrender to Queen Anno, gave back all their rights and powers over those waters. This surrender was made because the proprietors had no right of government strictly. Leaming & Spicer 613. Bac. Abr. til. Courts Palatinate. That their rights over navigable waters were surrendered, is proved — First, impliedly : because if the king, as already shewn, could not make such grants to an individual for a private purpose, the moment the great public object of the grant ceased, which was the creation of a qualified local government for the settlement and regulation of the country, the rights over these waters reverted to the king. Secondly, by express words, they surrender all powers, authorities, and privileges of and concerning the government. Leaming & Spicer 618. Privilege is an appropriate technical term to convey the idea of their rights under the prerogative, and was so understood by the proprietors. Leaming & Spicer 590. It is objected, that the proprietors, in their previous negotiations, claimed all their rights in the sea. So they make many other claims which were eventually abandoned, and there would have been in the surrender a reservation of the claim if it had not been abandoned. If these rights are not surrendered no other royalties are: such as waifs, estrays, forfeitures, felons’ goods, &c. Yet the queen understood they were surrendered. (See her instructions to Oornbury about forfeitures. Leaming & Spicer 627.) — But we now come to our second proposition. Suppose these rights over navigable waters, which the proprietors possessed, were not surrendered. Suppose further, that the king possessed, and the proprietors, while clothed *44with 'the powers of government, possessed the right of destroying, by alienations of the soil to individuals, the common' right of fishery of the people at large. Such a right would manifestly be a powerful act of sovereignty. It would be a strong high-handed exercise of legitimate arbitrary power against moral right, and not an exercise of power naturally and fairly inherent in the right possessed. When the proprietors, therefore, surrendered the government, if they retained their rights in the navigable waters subject to the common rights therein of the people, when they ceased to be clothed with the powers of government and sunk to the condition of common individuals, they could no longer exercise the high sovereign act of defeating the rights of the people in the navigable waters, but they and their alienees must hold them subject to such rights. It has been said, that whether the king had a right or not to grant these several exclusive fisheries in navigable rivers he did in fact grant them, and the proprietors have enjoyed them under the grant, and it is now too late to disturb them: I have already shewn that the king made no such grant; but if he had, and the proprietors had illegally enjoyed the possession under his grant, it would not avail them. Stationers’ Company v. Carnan, 2 Black. Rep. 1004; 7 Mod. 108. It is notorious, that the proprietors have never exercised such a right, but the people have been in the constant immemorial practice of using all the public waters for fishing and taking oysters. It is said, that these oysters were planted by the plaintiff, and that he has a right to them though deposited in a public river, and that they are different from running fish. But there is no such distinction. Pen. Reports 391; Richardson v. Mayor of Oxford, 2 H. Black. 182. Besides, in the present case, the plaintiff- threw his oysters on a natural oyster-bed, when the defendant unquestionably had a right to take oysters. The doctrine above contended for does not interfere with the fisheries on the Delaware, where the owners possess the exclusive right of haul upon the adjacent shores. *45 Scott, on same side. — It was incumbent on the plaintiff to shew a title. The possession of unenclosed premises is necessarily according to the-right. Arnold never held adverse or exclusive possession, and the act of throwing oysters on the flat, so far from being considered an act of possession,, has been adjudged by this court an abandonment of them to the common mass. 1 Pen. 391, 395. Possession, then, out of the question, we must return to the inquiry of title, and here the title to the farm adjacent does not aid the plaintiff, for that, in terms, excludes the place where the supposed trespass was committed. It therefore became necessary to shew a survey or conveyance to evince that the title was .out of the council of proprietors, in conformity with the doctrine urged by the plaintiff himself. He does not give or offer in evidence any conveyance or assurance from the proprietors; no common law title ,is offered, but he shows a survey bearing date 13th April, 1818. When it was recorded, does not appear; when it was inspected and approved, does not appear; that it ever was inspected and approved, does not appear. Inspection, approbation, &c., are substantive acts, and the subject matter of clear proof. The state (Pat. N. J. Laws 82, sec. 3) enacts, “that any survey made of any lands within either the eastern or western division of the proprietors of the state of New Jersey, and inspected and approved by the general proprietors or council of proprietors of such division, and, by their order or direction, entered upon record in the secretary’s office of this state, or the surveyor-general’s office of such division, shall, from and after such record is made, preclude and for ever bar such proprietors and their successors from any demand thereon, any plea of deficiency of right, or otherwise, notwithstanding.” This survey is now produced under the operation of this statute, to excuse the non-production of a direct conveyance from the proprietors to the plaintiff in this cause. In the acknowledged absence of all conveyance from them, shall it be sufficient to make the *46defendant liable, as a trespasser, to him who causes the survey to be made ? The survey is made wholly at the instance, and. under the direction, of the.party. It requires no warrant, • and, in this- case, had none accompanying it. Suppose a man ijó walk over unlocated lands between the time of a survey and the time of its being recorded, against whom does he trespass, the proprietors or that individual who has caused the survey to be made ? Is it certain that the survey will ever be recorded ? Many caveats interpose, and evince that it is unlawful to record. Many preferences are given by the statute, which the council are to decide. If we imagine conflicting surveys, we shall be brought to the conclusion, inevitably, that the act of the council is essential to the title. Inspecting, approving, and recording the survey are, by this law, in the absence of all ordinary and regular conveyance; made equal to the delivery of a deed, and the time of delivery, beyond all controversy, is the time when the title passes. To my mind it seems clear that this is the only rational construction of the statute.' From and after such record is made the survey shall be operative, and it shall, from and after that time, preclude and for ever bar, &c. But admitting, for the sake of argument, that a title, such as the proprietors could grant, was vested in the plaintiff, antecedent to the supposed trespass, we must proceed to examine what that title is. The plaintiff claims an exclusive fishery in and upon certain parts of the Raritan river, where the tide ebbs and flows. There is a natural' oyster-bed there, and it is below low water mark. The defendant, Mundy, has taken oysters from this bed, and this is the supposed trespass. Our first proposition is, that.the proprietors have no right to survey a navigable river, where the tide ebbs and flows, for the purpose of vesting private and exclusive rights therein in individuals. Our second proposition is, that the people have a vested right, communis piscarice in such riverá, by the common law. . Our argument under the first of .these heads-is, .that .by prerogative, the king of England, in navigable rivers, has a *47right of fishery, (not several nor exclusive) and that he has an exclusive right to royal fish ; that he has and holds these rights by prerogative only, as incident to the kingly office and sovereignty, and that, therefore, he cannot convey the sea, nor an arm of the sea, nor a navigable river, to a private individual for a private purpose. Wo place our argument on this broad basis, and insist that this is the doctrine of the common law, of civil law, and of national law. The case of a cession from one sovereignty to another, as in the case of Louisiana, the Floridas, and the immense countries west of the Missouri, does not bear upon this subject. In the entire cession of the countries, the seas and the rivers, of course, go with the sovereignty. We insist that although between the ascent to the throne by William the ■Oonqueror, whose title evinces that his crown was the crown of conquest, and Magna Gharta, the king did actually grant out navigable rivers, exclusive fisheries, weirs in rivers, &c., yet it was contrary to common law and common right. The Norman succession considered England precisely as the counsel opposed to us consider this country, a conquered country. And they endeavored to impose that law on Englishmen, “ the pleasure of the king,” which we are now told was the law, the true and real law binding on our ancestors. The extortions and exactions of the followers and favorites -of the Norman usurpation, far transcending their policy or their wisdom, finally roused the spirit of Englishmen. Their Saxon liberties were still remembered with the fondest .recollection, and the barons, the nobles, the great men et tota communitas Anglice, with one vigorous exertion of their strength, asserted the return of their ancient rights and laws, and, on the plains of Runnymede, received their acknowledgment in the first charter. They considered this -charter as a great confirmation of many of their liberties; as the restoration of many of the great principles of the common law; as restraining the king from preventing the people of their rights and securing many important principles. *48 'Magna Charta, then, was the great fundamental.law of England, binding alike on prince, noble and peasant; securing rights and prohibiting their infringment. . This charter, cap. 16, declares — “ No banks shall henceforth be fenced, but such as w.ere in defence in the time of our grandfather, King Henry, by the same places and by the same bounds as they were accustomed in his time.” Sir Edward Ooke’s comment on this statute (2 Inst. 30) explains it in a style so decisive that there is no escape. He says, “ that is no owner of the banks of rivers shall so appropriate or keep’ the rivers several to him, to defend or bar others, either to have passage or fish there, .otherwise than they were used in the reign of King Henry II.”, See also cap. 23 of Magna Charta. To the same effect is 2 Black. Com. 39; and in Salk. 357 and 6 Mod. 73, we have the decision of that great constitutional Judge Holt, that the king’s grant cannot bar-a subject from fishing in a navigable river. In 2 Sul. Feud. Law 241, 1 Reeve 234, Willes 265, 2 Bos. Pul. 472, 1 Camp. 312, we have the same doctrines and principles quoted and remarked on with high approbation; and that these principles are not peculiar to the law of England, but are co-extensive with civilization and the government of law we have but to turn to Coop. Justin. 67, 1 Vattel 11, 117, and 2 Domat. 399. The answer to this is not satisfactory to my mind. It is, that the king had the right of soil, and could grant it, and that with the grant of the soil, and as incident thereto, the fishery must go. It is fairly admitted that the king has the right of soil in navigable rivers, as a royalty as incident to, and inseparable from, his character of sovereign, but it by no means follows, that he may alien that which he holds quasi in trust for the subject. Unusual pains and industry have produced against us the case reported in Davies 150, and Sir Matthew Hale’s treatise in Mar. L. T. The case in Davies was decided in Ireland', in the reign of James I., when the royal prerogative was at the highest; when the jus divinum was every*49where taught, believed and ruled; and when contest with the kingly power, in defence of the subject’s right, was esteemed the madness of folly. Nevertheless, there is nothing there decided at war with the great principles for which we contend. 11 is said that every river where the tide ebbs is a royal river, and that the fishery is a royal fishery, and belongs to the king by prerogative ; and that he shall have exclusive right of royal fish. Let me ask, why is the phrase exclusive applied to royal fish if he has the right of excluding the subject 1'rom other fish ? The sole object intended ,by citing Sir Matthew Hale’s treatise was to prove that there actually were, and are to this day, in England, several and exclusive fisheries in navigable rivers. Magna Charla acknowledged it hundreds of years ago, but enacted that none should continue, except such as were in use in the lifetime. Henriei regis avi nostri et per eadem loea et eosdem términos. I understand this great man as inquiring into the titles of exclusive fishery, and the result is, there are two. 1. Grant. 2. Prescription of immemorial use, which implies a grant. The times or the dates of these grants had not become the question in discussion, and, besides, many grants of several fishery might have emanated from the crown, such as had been acquired by forfeiture, escheat, or in a variety of ways. I ask for the evidence, that the king may now create a new several of fishery. It is that alone which is prohibited by Magna Charta. Lord Hale certainly produces no instance of a modern grant, none so late as the reign of King John. I think the conclusion therefore obvious, that the kings of England are, by the policy of the law, the owners of the beds of navigable rivers, yet that it is a qualified ownership, and such as that they cannot part with for private purposes, but must hold them quasi in trust for the subject. The grant from King Charles II. to the duke of York was, I think, founded on-these principles. The conveyance was of New York and New Jersey, with power of government, and *50reserving an appeal to the king in council. He entered to make the duke of York a sub-sovereign; he conveyed the lands to him as a subject, and the royalties as a sovereign. He understood well that these navigable rivers belonged to the sovereignty. They continued in the sovereign still, for he alone could hold them, as trustee, fo'r the subject’s use. .-It is a little remarkable how mere a self-murder the argument of our opposing counsel is, when applied to the fisheries in the Delaware river. In the conveyance from the duke of York to Carteret and Berkley, the western extremity is the eastern margin of the Delaware. The river Delaware was not conveyed to them, that remained in sovereignty; and now we are told, that the divisional line of this state extends westward only to the east margin of the Delaware. It does not extend an inch into the river; and yet many men, from owning the adjacent soil, are the owners of valuable fisheries. Examine this position one moment. The boundary of the state is the east margin of the river, and yet there are fisheries appurtenant, out of the state, to invade which would be a. trespass, and clausum fregit would lie. I deny every word of this doctrine. The State of New Jersey, as a free and sovereign state, extends usque ad medium filum aquce, east and west. In the character and capacity of proprietors, Carteret and Berkley took neither the Hudson nor the Delaware. So far forth as sovereignty was created, and no farther,.were these great navigable rivers given; the land only was given, and rivers not navigable, the only lawful objects of property. When New Jersey and Pennsylvania became free and sovereign, the Delaware rolled between them, and, ipso facto,■ the centre of that river became the division line, until a .mutual convention between them settled their boundary; and such, we are sure, was their apprehension of the matter, for, by treaty, they divided the river and the islands within it. Un like manner is the divisional line with Hew York ■ ultimately to be settled. Precisely the reasoning urged *51against us would bring the jurisdiction of New York to high water mark on the Jei'sey shore. New York answers to our claims, and reasons just as the council of proprietors do here. The whole of the two states was given to tho duke of York; wliat was not sold off remains to us. New Jersey, by special metes, was sold off, and you are to take this strict measure? Not so. Tho great river Hudson vested and remained in the sovereignty till the declaration of independence ; it then became a great natural boundary, and vested in the sovereignties of the two states, and the middle is the proper boundary until treaty shall establish another. The result seems to me to bo conclusively this, that the sovereign has allodium of the soil of the sea and its arms; a right of fishery, quasi in trust for all the citizens and subjects; that ho has the exclusive right to royal fish; that fishery and navigation are co-extensivc; the subject in a limited government, and tho citizen in a free republic have, in my mind, the undoubted commune) n piseariam and the right of navigation. The king’s prerogative in England may be, and often is, one of the subject’s rights; the sea is res communis. In relation to newly discovered countries, our original proposition seems to me unimpaired. The soil and the rivers are a great national domain. The country must be inhabited, or the king loses his right; and when inhabited, the people carry with them the same rights and privileges they had, in the mother country. I said, before, that fishery and navigation were co-extcnsive. If King Charles II. could grant, and did grant, all of New Jersey, all tho rivers, &c., for private purposes; if there was no public law to restrain him in the use; if his assignees stand in pari rations; and if, under this conveyance, now after the bond of union between this country and England is severed for ever, the assignees, the lords proprietors, can assert the right and exercise it too, of parcelling out exclusive fisheries in the navigable rivers; if their claim be just and lawful, viz: that the whole was theirs, and what is not *52sold still remains to them, I ask, what is to prevent their taxing navigation and commerce? Every sloop that sails commits a trespass. This controversy about the oysters is but the entering wedge; the shad fisheries and the navigation come next; and the same process of reasoning which will justify the one, in like manner will establish the other. Their title to the rivers, we are told, was not a public title for public use, in which all the citizens had an interest, but it was a private individual interest of their own, the subject of sale for money. It is a plain and direct assertion, that fisheries, navigation and bridges belong exclusively to them. I have taken no notice of the conveyance of sovereignty to the lords proprietors; it is not here necessary to discuss that. The decision in the reign of Queen Anne was, that they could not lawfully exercise jurisdiction and government, and the surrender of the government to her was founded on that decision. But if the government did pass by the grant of the duke of York to Carteret and Berkley, and if their assigns could, and did, take the government by virtue of their grant, it is clear that they took the royalties therein mentioned, rivers, bays, ports, coasts of the sea, &o., in the character of sovereignty, as that common property of the nation, the nominal ownership of which is ascribed to the sovereign, but which is held in trust, and of which all have a common right to partake. The surrender to Queen Anne restored all these royalties to the crown of England, if they ever wTere separated. It follows, that upon the Revolution, when the people of New Jersey became free, sovereign and independent, all these royalties vested in them the legal title and the use existing in the same; and that the legislature of this state never having given any exclusive right or title to the plaintiff, he is without right or title, and was, therefore, properly called at the trial. _5. Stockton, in reply, after stating the case from the record generally, said — This non-suit, if supported, would *53be of serious import to an important species of property ■which had been claimed and enjoyed from the first settlement of New Jersey; it struck at the root of all title of several fishery in navigable rivers in the State of New Jersey, a property all important to numerous respectable families located on those rivers, and enjoyed uninterruptedly until this defence had called it into question. The plaintiff’s complaint was for breaking his close covered with water and taking away planted oysters. To sustain his suit, it was incumbent on him to prove — 1. That he had title and possession of the locus in quo. 2. That the oysters were his. 3. That the defendant entered and took them. These points being established, it would rest with the defendant to shew that he had a right to enter and do what he did. The place where, &c., was a mud flat on the river Raritan, opposite the farm of the plaintiff, the greater part between high and low water mark, all between the land and the channel of the river, and being of no kind of benefit to, and utterly unfit for, navigation. To this ground tho plaintiff sets up his titles. 1. By the common law, as being a mud flat between a navigable river and the plaintiff’s farm, bounded by the river, and being immediately opposite to his farm. 2. By a proprietary survey, made prior to the trespass, by which the whole premises were conveyed to him by the proprietors, which would operate either as a new grant, or a confirmation, according as it might be necessary to apply it to the subject matter. I. As to his title to the fiat, as opposite and adjoining his main farm. It is true, that at the common law, this right seems to be restricted to high water mark, in the case of navigable or public rivers, but extends to the channel, or ad filum aquae, in private rivers, or those not navigable. It might be contended, with much reliance, that all the rivers included within the conveyance from Charles II. to the duke of York ceased to be public, and were made private rivers *54by the conveyance to the duke, he being then a subject, and the property being a country wild and uninhabited, except by savage tribes. Upon this ground, perhaps, it is that Swift in his System, vol. I. 343, lays down the general proposition “that in navigable rivers, every proprietor of land is deemed to have the exclusive right in rivers-and seas adjoining his .land to the channeland he adds, “ that no person may take oysters or any shell-fish from their beds in front of another’s land, or draw a seine for other fish, though he does not for that purpose enter upon the land of the adjoining proprietor.” It is also a notorious fact, that in the discussion which took place some years ago between the commissioners of this state and Hew York, our commissioners defended our claim to the channel of the Hudson upon the ground, that to all purposes, but that of navigation, that river must be considered as a private river. Rep. of Com. 14, 15. This report was made to the legislature; their proceedings approved, and their argument published under the sanction of the legislature. II. But it is unnecessary to press this point, because we gave in evidence a survey and location of the oyster-bed, regularly made, in virtue of a proprietary right, before the trespass complained of. One of the adverse counsel has taken an exception to this title in limine, that although “this survey and location was made prior, yet it was recorded after the trespass, as if the title was founded on. the record, or even the approbation by the counsel of the proprietors, and not on the actual survey and location.” I shall not stop to answer this objection. The Chief Justice, in his opinion, has fully and ably disposed of it; his reasoning on that point needs no aid from, the bar; it will take care of itself, and there it will be left by me. The general question then is, whether these mud flats did not pass in full propriety to the plaintiff, either by his title to the main farm, or by this particular survey ? If the title *55to this flat ever was in the proprietors, it certainly has passed to us. That it was in the proprietors, no court of justice in New Jersey is at liberty to deny. This title has the same foundation upon which rests all title to real estaté here; it is simple and conclusive. Charles II. claiming and in possession of the whole, conveys to the duke of York'a much greater territory. The terms of the grant are as extensive as the English language affords, and as English lawyers could put into a conveyance. It convoys “ all -the lands, soils, rivers, waters, harbors, fishings, fowlings; royalties, profits, commodities, and appurtenances in foe simple, together with the powers of government, with the exceptions, that he holds of the king by the tenure' of free soc-age, and that his laws shall be assimilated, as near as may be, to the laws of England. The duke conveys, in the very same terms, to Carteret and Berkley; and all. their right? have been transmitted, by mesne conveyances, to the present proprietors. They purchased not only the soil and waters, but the government also, and were the lords, legislators, and owners of the territory, as fully as the duke had been. Who, then, can doubt but that as all our title to land must be deduced from this grant, so, according to the terms used and the intent of both parties, it did pass, not only the fast land, but also all those parts of the sea shore, bays, and rivers not considered as part of the fast land; which a king of England acquiring title to a new and uninhabited country would legally grant and convey. - It is admitted on all hands, that the fast land to high water mark passed;, and it has been, and will be, abundantly shewn, that the rest, to ivit, the shore between high and low water mark, the flats, bays, rivers, and waters, from the sea to high water mark, passed. Now, without going at present into the question of gene-t ral right to several fishery incidental to, and inseparably attached, as we think it is, to the right of. soil, may we not say, that the plaintiff’s evidence sustained his case, and that *56he ought not, to. have been non-suited. We shew that the land was ours; that the plaintiff -purchased .the oysters; planted'them on his own ground; staked that ground off, but not ,so as to interfere either with the right of taking Swimming fish or of free navigation. Thus did the plaintiff purchase, and plant on his own soil, the fry of shell-fish taken from distant natural beds, with intent to improve them; but the defendant entered his close, with tongs took the- oysters out of the .very soil, and converted them to his own use. Did not these oysters belong to the plaintiff? The original foundation of all personal property is appropriation at the expense, and by the labor, of the claimant. 2 Black. Com. 9, 391. In respect to animals called in law feres natures, which can, when in a state of nature, have no particular owner, it is emphatically so. Deer put into a park, rabbits in a warren, fish in a pond, become private property by caption and detention. The cáse of .oysters planted on a man’s own soil is at least as strong. The plaintiff’s case includes in it every principle of original acquisition, the payment of the purchase money, made the fry the property of plaintiff; the labor in planting them; the deposit on his own land; constituted each a good foundation of exclusive property; nor could such an act of planting, though in the water, amount to an abandonment. Such was not the intention nor tendency of the act; but the very reverse was intended when he planted them in his own soil and put up public visible marks,,distinguishing them from all others. If, then, such be the foundation of all property; if exclusive right to the fish, that swim, the deer that bound, and to the bird that flies, may be acquired by appropriation, why shall he not have in the oysters which he has purchased with his money, planted by his labor, and deposited on Ms own soil, from which they never can depart of themselves, the same rights ? What is the answer of the adverse counsel? It is that this o.yster-bed is. located in a navigable river, where the tide *57ebbs and flows, the defendant had a common right to fish there, and, therefore, his entry and taking away the oysters was lawful. Waiving, at present, the position I shall hereafter endeavor to maintain, that the plaintiff has shewn full title to a several fishery on this ground, for all kinds of fish; I shall here deny that there was any common right to take these fish. The common right, where it exists, is confined to fish in t-hoir natural state, swimming, if they are floating fish, and if they are shell-fish, in a state of nature where they are spawned. It is clear that at common law, the owner of a river might make a weir across it, if it did not injure the navigation, because it was his own, and such a weir,per se, made a several fishery. Har. L. T. 18, 22, 23. 4 Mass. Rep. 527. Now here is a grant of the land itself, laid in front of the plaintiffs farm, of moderate and reasonable extent, not at all impeding or injuring the navigation, appropriating only a mud flat, planted with small fry at private expense ; how, upon any sound principle, can a pretended common right to fish authorize an individual, against the will of the owner, forcibly to enter and carry them off? What is a common of fishery ? It is a mere privilege or franchise; it is no title to the land or fish; a mere privilege to take fish, and must be used reasonably; to extend it further than to take fish in their natural state, is unjust and unreasonable, and therefore unlawful. It would permit what the law reprobates, the taking the property of another without compensation. To support it is little better than to authorize plunder, whatever fine names it may go by. No case can be shown, justifying the taking of fish out of a pool, pond, or weir in a navigable river, under pretence of the common right. The only question in such cases is, whether the pond, pool, or weir is a nuisance to the navigation ? It is said that on this ground there were some oysters naturally bred. Suppose there were, did this authorize the .defendant to take those which the plaintiff had planted *58there ? It was incumbent on the defendant to have shewn in evidence, that those he took were natural oysters.. He made no pretence of this; on the contrary, it is stated by the report of the Chief Justice, that -he took the oysters planted by the plaintiff. • Again — it was said that mixing them with the natural oysters destroyed our property. Hot so. There was no evidence that the rows of planted oysters could not be distinguished from the natural. The defendant had sufficient ground left upon which to exercise his right. The owner of the soil has a right to fence in if he leaves enough for common use. 2 Bac. 392. The court, instead of non-suiting the plaintiff, should have put it to the jury to decide whether the oysters taken were those planted? whether they could be distinguished from the natural oysters ? and whether there was not common enough left, by the plaintiff unenclosed ? If we are owners of the soil, the defendant had no right to enter and take the oysters from the soil; our act in planting and appropriating amounted only to a’ surcharge of the common.. In such case the commoner is put to his action. The case of Cooper v. Marshall (1 Bur. 259) is full in point. In England, the fight of property in .oyster-beds in navigable rivers is acknowledged as existing at common law, and is protected by penal statutes. 3 Chitty’s Crown Law 359. By the statute 31 George III., chap. 51, the taking oysters from such beds is made a misdemeanor. 3 Chitty’s Crown Law 359. By the 48 George .III,, chap. 144, it is made felony; yet. there is no prior statute making such beds in navigable rivers the subject of private property. By. these statutes, the legislature recognize oyster-beds and the oysters there planted as private property, and protect it by making the spoliation, thereof-an indictable offence. 5 Esp. Rep. 62. 1 Camp. 309. In the cases which have occurred under these statutes, this idea of common right to take oysters, has never been set up as a justification of the ■ offence; but the distinction between floating *59fish in a state of nature, and oysters in a bed, is recognized. In the case of the State v. Capt. Lewis, who was indicted for an assault upon these same Woodbridge men, in defending his oyster-bed adjoining the premises, tried at the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Middlesex county a few years ago, he was defended on his right of property to the bed and the oysters which he had' planted; and although the assault was by presenting a loaded pistol, attended by a threat of inflicting death if the trespassers did not desist, and was fully proved, yet the defendant was acquitted by the jury on the charge of the Chief Justice, that Capt. Lewis had a right to defend his property, and that what he did, did not exceed the hounds of defence. . This case, compared with the present, affords a strong instance of discrepancy in judicial opinions. One citizen loads his pistol, takes the field and drives off the plunderers, acting, as they did, on this same pretence of common right; another citizen, not so adventurous, submits peaceably, appeals to the law of the land, and is- non-suited by the same respectable judge by whose direction the other had been acquitted ! . The principles of private right and of public convenience require that this species of property should be protected. The oysters on the open beds are nearly exhausted; the rakers have become so numerous that oysters are not permitted to attain any maturity; they are small and worthless — lienee the price of those fit for use is greatly enhanced; but if this reasonable use of a man’s own soil is permitted and protected, every land owner on the shores of our bays and salt rivers will have an oyster-bed; the quantity brought into market will bring down the price, so that the poor as well as rich may eat and be glad. The only other case which has occurred in New Jersey was cited from 1 Pen. 391, by the adverse counsel. But in that case the planter of the oysters had no pretence of right of soil; he was not the owner of the adjoining farm, nor had he’ made any location of the premises; he was merely a way*60faring man, who dropt his oysters in a navigable river. At the time when that case was decided it seemed quite clear, from the anxiety manifested by the judges to protect planted oysters, that if he had been owner of the soil he would have been successful. II. General point. — But not to rest on this particular case, as forming an exception to a general rule, I shall follow the adverse counsel through the great point which they have labored, and, notwithstanding the learned arguments we have heard,-I submit it, that our claim to a several fishery has been fully sustained. The adverse counsel yield 'to us some of our ground. They seemed to admit that these rivers, bays and waters, with, the land they cover, are the subjects of exclusive property, and that by the law of England the king is the general owner. The points debated are — 1. Could the king lawfully grant a right of several fishery in a navigable river ? and did he grant such a right to the duke of York, and he to the proprietors ? 2. If he could, and such right did originally pass; was it' surrendered by the proprietors to Queen Anne ? 1. The right of the king of England to make such a grant is denied by the defendant’s counsel. But it has already been shewn — -1. That, by the common law, the king had such a right. 2. That there was no statute of England which prohibited the king from making such a grant of lands in New Jersey. 1. Charles II. as king of England, was owner of New Jei'sey. His title was such as was recognized by all civilized nations, discovery of a new and before unknown territory inhabited by savages — conquest from the Indians and Dutch ; these were the foundations of his right. We have an authentic history of these transactions. The English first discovered and took possession of this part of North America. Being at war with the states of Holland, they were driven out by their enemy, who took possession and built the city of New York, then called New Amsterdam. They extended *61their settlements into New Jersey, particularly into the adjacent counties of Bergen, Essex, Monmouth, Somerset and Middlesex, the first inhabitants of which were generally Hollanders. But in 1664, the English re-conquered the territory and expelled the Dutch government. The king thus gained a new title, by conquest over a civilized owner. His grantee, the duke of York, took complete possession, and the whole landed property of New Jersey is hold immediately from the king of England. He held it not merely in point of jurisdiction, but also in ownership. It was unappropriated land, a savage wilderness, a great waste. To such property the law appoints the king as owner, because there is no other. Moreover, it is a fundamental principle of the common law, that all lands, even those of private men, are held of the king. Where there is no private owner, therefore, all persons must claim title through him. 2 Black. Com. 49, 50. In respect to the old settled and granted lands in England this may be a fiction of law, but it is truth and history here. It was a newly discovered wilderness, conquered by the king of England; it was his from necessity, and belonged to him solely, substantially and beneficially. Thus, being the lord and owner of the land, shores, rivers, bays and waters, he conveys to the duke of York as fully and amply as he held them, except only that his title was allodial, the duke’s feudal, in free and common socage. Not only does he convey the full propriety, but to make it more full, and as extensive as possible, ho grants also the powers of government. The duke conveys to Berkley and Carteret, and they to the proprietors, as fully and extensively as the same were conveyed to the duke. This was a solemn deliberate act, well considered at the timo, and intended to convey all which the granting words imply. It was twice conveyed, the first grants were in 1664, but at the date of the first grant to the duke, the Dutch were in possession, but they were expelled the same year. Ten years afterwards, doubts being enter-*62tamed whether the re-conquest did not give the king a new title, notwithstanding his grant of 1664, he, in 1674, made a second grant to the duke, and he to the proprietors, in the same terms with the first. Then, to wit: in July, 1676, followed the deed of partition,' commonly called the quinti parte deed, by which East Jersey is assigned to Carteret, and West Jersey to Berkley; and afterwards, in 1682, the trustees of Carteret convey East Jersey to the twelve proprietors, under whom the present proprietors claim. All these mesne conveyances adopt the words of the original grant in extenso, constituting the proprietors as fully owners and governors as the duke, or even the king himself had been, saving only their allegiance to the British crown. Under this title did the proprietors take possession as owners and rulers. They appointed their governor, made their constitutions, granted lands, and did everything which pertained' to full and absolute ownership and dominion. This title, and the proceedings of the proprietors under it, were repeatedly confirmed by the English monarchs, nor were their powers ever questioned until a short time before the surrender of the government to Queen Anne, and then nothing further was questioned than the grant of the important powers of political government. Was all this delusion? Had the grantees really no beneficial interest ? Were they trustees for the expected settlers, or the true owners and proprietors of everything included legally in the forms of the grants? Let every landholder, every owner of several fishery, from Hackensack to Cape May, look well to the answer given to these questions, all our titles depend upon it; the answer of law, liberty and justice at this time of day is, that all which the grants purport to grant, were legally and effectually granted. By the common law,"" the‘king is the owner of all navigable rivers, bays and shores below low water mark, and he owns them, not as trustee, but in full dominion and *63propriety. Davies 152 to 155; 6 Com. Dig. tit. Prerogative 55 (D 50); 5 ib. Navigation (A) 102; Har. L. T. 10, 11. He has as full a right to grant and convey, at the common law, as a private man has to convey his farm, and this law has annexed to this right but two limitations. 1. That these waters shall remain highways for passage and navigation. 2. That while they remain ungranted there is a common right of fishery therein. The cases cited fully prove, that in places over which the tide ebbs and flows, between high and low water mark (seaward) the king, by the common law, has not only the jurisdiction but ike property. This was the law as understood by Lord líale, a most learned judge, not inclined to stretch the rights of the crown, and that even in regard to the waters, seas and rivers within the English dominions. How much stronger is the case here, as to waters washing a newly-acquired territory uninhabited only by the savage tribes, and acquired by conquest. That the king, as owner, may grant to an individual a several fishery in a navigable river, is the received common law of England. 5 Com. Dig. Navigation B, 102; Har. L. T. 17, 18, 19, 22, 23; ib. 34-5, particularly the case of Crow v. Johnson. These authorities are express to the point, and need no comment. Neither Lord Halo nor Chief Baron Comyns understood the rule of the common law to bo what the counsel contend for. What answer is given to these cases ? The adverse counsel say, that they refer to old grants made by the kings of England, by usurpation, before the passing the celebrated statute of Magna Charla; that such grants are prohibited by this statute, and, therefore, the grant was void as to the right of fishery. This position of the defendant’s counsel is not founded in law. Have we not proved that the king is owner by the common law ? Shall he then, of all owners, be the only one who cannot grant all that belonged to him ? This is in truth reversing the most fundamental principle of the English law, which *64gives to the king, by his prerogative, more ample powers than any subject can possess. Lord Hale makes no such distinction. He wrote in the reign of this same king, two centuries after Magna Charta, and he considers it then as perfectly clear that the king might lawfully grant these exclusive water rights. If such grants were considered usurpations, why were they not annulled by course of law ? Would so great and learned a lawyer as Hale have treated them with such respect, if they were all unlawful by the common law ? The gentlemen are obliged to concede, that an individual may claim a several fishery in a navigable river by prescription. This concession admits the legal power of the king to grant, for it is a first rule of this branch of the law, that nothing can be prescribed for which could not be granted. Prescription presupposes a grant, which from length of time cannot be shewn. 7 Coke’s Rep. 18; 2 Black. Com. 264. When, therefore, modern judges and writers agree that you may prescribe for a several fishery, they do admit that if the grant could be shewn it would be good, for prescription means usage, time out of mind, founded on original grant. The true rule has not been given to us by the adverse counsel; it is this, that prima facie fishery in a navigable river is common. He who sets up an exclusive right must shew title by either grant or prescription, presumed by the law to be founded on grant. Indeed, if ownership of the soil is essential to a right of several fishery, it does not seem strictly correct to say, that you may make title to it by prescription, for soil cannot pass by prescription. It is more accurate to say, that by prescription a right of common fishery may be destroyed. That the plaintiff’s right to several fishery may be established by grant, and the defendant’s prima facie right of common destroyed by it is fully proved. Chief Baron Oomyns says, “ So a man by grant or prescription may have several fishery in a navigable river. 6 Com. Dig. 56. This is his own position; he afterwards *65cites the case of Warren v. Matthews, cited against us as being contra, in his manner, when he thinks the ease is not law. Lord Mansfield gives the same rule as laid down by Oomyns. 4 Bur. 2164. And Justice Yates says, in express terms, that several fishery passes by grant or prescription. AVe have then the authority of such great men as Hale, Oomyns, Mansfield and Yates, to prove that, by the common law, a right of several fishery may be granted. That the words of these grants do convey a several fishery, if by law it may be conveyed, has been fully demonstrated by the opening counsel. It passes by a grant of the soil, which is as well of the water over the soil as of the soil under the water. Har. L. T. 17, 19; 5 Bur. 2814; Davies 180-1. It has never been doubted but that-a conveyance of the soil passes fishery. The doubt has been, whether there could be a right of several fishery without the soil, {Doug. 56) and the modern opinion seems to be that there cannot. A right of several fishery is not a mere appurtenance to the land, but the land itself, and, therefore, when the land passes so must the fishery. Hence Lord Hale and Chief Justice Parsons say, that making a weir rightfully makes a several fishery. So, by a grant of all waters, several fishery passes. In ornease the grants are drawn with an evident intent to pass all which the king could grant, either as land or as water. Then if the king, by the common law, was competent to grant, and did grant, a right of several fishery, the remaining question is, whether this right was taken away by statute ? III. The celebrated Magna Charta is relied on, or rather two sections of that statute, to wit, the 16th and 23d, and when the words of these sections are read it is no small tax upon the gravity of argument to discuss its application to the present case. 16th Section, Statute at large — “Ho banks shall be defended but such as were in defence in the time of King Henry our *66grandfather.” The counsel for the defendant asserts, that this section, prohibited Charles II. from granting to the duke of York the waters of New Jersey. Who-c.an forbear a smile ?• What banks are meant, the banks of the Hudson, Raritan, Delaware, Potomac, or Mississippi? What did “ our grandfather King Henry ” know about them ? The banks intended by the parliament are those of the great navigable waters of England; it is local in its provision on its very face. How “ defended ” by sticking poles of'willow whips in a mud 'flat, over which the smallest boat at high water can glide, to mark out an oyster-bed at Amboy ! Is this the “ defence ” which that statute was intended to put down? No! the famous barons who extorted that statute from John, spoke of those artificial banks or mounds raised in navigable rivers in England, by which not only the natural passage of the fish was stopped but also the navigation interrupted. This sixteenth section was so illy penned and useless, and the object so much better attained by subsequent statutes, that even when Bracton wrote it was .considered out of use in England. 2 Inst. 30. And Judge Blackstone, in his tracts, analyzing this famous statute, does not even give us either of these sections. 23d Section, Statute at large 6— “All weirs shall be utterly put down by Thames and 'Medway and through all England, except on the sea coast.” This in its terms is local, confined to the realm of England; and what does it enact even there ? What is a weir ? It is a dam across a river. But did it mean, even there, that there should be neither dam nor stake stuck in the mud in any mud flat in England ? It meant simply to prohibit nuisances. If the weir did no injury it was not within the purview or intent of the statute. For this exposition we give the authority of Coke and Hale, and the parliament of England. Har. L. T. 9. Hale, after giving the words of this section of the statute, says it was meant to restrain nuisances, and “ these .nuisances were such as hindered the passage of boats.” Ib. *6722. Again — commenting on this and some subsequent statutes, Lord Hale says, “ and by force of these statutes, weirs that were prejudicial to the passage of vessels were to be pulled down. Btd that did no way disaffirm the property, but only remove the annoyance.” The statutes 25 Edward III. chap. 4, and 1 Henry IV. chap. 12, were passed to amend and explain these senseless sections ; (1 Statute at large 260. Ib. 429) and Lord Coke, in commenting on them all, says “the generality of the words of the 23d section of Magna Charta are corrected and restricted, by the two subsequent statutes, to such erections as were nuisances.” 13 Coke 35. In 3 Bur. 1768, we find a case of several fishery in the river Thames, and the court say upon this subject, “ that a man may do anything with his own which is not a nuisance.” Here we have a sensible practical explanation of these old English statutes, and it becomes useless to inquire whether any part of the local prohibitory provisions of the statute law of the mother country applied to this new acquisition ? There was much crude opinion in England on the general question of the statute law extending here. Lord Holt, the great whig Chief Justice of England, on whose sole authority the general point of the adverse counsel rests, says, “ the law of England does not extend to Virginia; her law is what the king pleases.” Salk. 666. He probably meant the statute law of England, and perhaps he was right so far, speaking as an English judge. The doctrine of the colonists here was, that so much of the statute law as suited their condition was brought over, as well as the common law; and further, they undertook to say what did suit them. But the first proprietors and settlers did not repose themselves upon the statutes of England for their rights and liberties, but took care to grant on the one side and secure on the other, in what is called the grants and concessions, all the great principles of English liberty. The great political clauses of Magna Charta, particularly the 29th section, *68•which is the bill of rights of the people of England, is adopted word for word, and incorporated into the grants and concessions. These grants and concessions do in fact exhibit an original contract between the people and their rulers, a complete free written constitution. The venerable ancestors of the people of New Jersey have the uncommon honor of having first reduced to practice the theory of original contract between the governor and the people, and of presenting to the world the first written constitution which effectually secured the religious and civil liberty of the settlers. They wanted not the protection of English statutes, finally to be construed and applied, or not, by English judges. They demanded and received a constitution of their 'own, securing to them and their children all the benefits of a free government. And yet the learned counsel accuse us of advancing and advocating slavish principles, because we insist that these miserable samples of rude legislation contained in the above sections of an English statute, speaking of our grandfather Henry, and of the Thames and Medway, ought to be excluded from all operation now in New Jersey. There is nothing, then, in the statutes relied on interfering with our title, and the question recurs, might not the king, by the common law, grant the soil, and with it several fishery in the colony of New Jersey ? The dictum of Judge Blacks tone is relied on. 2 Black. Com. 39. He is the first elementary writer who denies to the king the power of granting since the statute of Magna Charta, but this part of the great work was reviewed by the learned author after Mr. Hargrave’s observations upon his doctrine of fishery, and is now carefully penned, and is expressly confined.to a grant by the king of the franchise of free fishery. He does not say, that the king could not grant the soil of a river, and, of course, several fishery as part of that soil. The distinction between several and free fishery, in respect of such grants, is palpable and obvious. The right of free fishery is an exclusive right to *69take fish in a navigable river not granted away, but belonging to the king by his prerogative. In the king’s hands, the common right of taking fish in all the people attaches to it, and he may now grant to a favorite an exclusive right, and yet remain owner jure coronce, for while the property is in him, such exclusive right is in derogation of the common right of the subject. But if the king grants the soil, the presumption of law is, that he grants it for good reasons, and that no prejudice will flow from it, and it immediately becomes the freehold of the party. The grantee holds it subject to the jus publicum, (which is not the common right of fishery) and must take -care that he erects no nuisance; but under this limitation it is as much his as the fast land, and he cannot be deprived of it without injustice. 2 Cruise 297, also cited against us, follows Blackstone, uses his cautious language, and confines the restriction to the franchise of free fishery. It is true that Lord Holt, in the case of Warren v. Matthews, before alluded to, as reported in 6 Mod. 73, cited against us, is made to say, that there can be no several fishery in a navigable river. As it stands in the book, it is a mere dietum. What the particulars of the case were does not appear, and the general position is not considered as law by Hale, Comyns, Mansfield, and Yates. It is asserted by the adverse counsel, that the old grants of several fishery were usurpations contrary to the common law. No case has been, or can be, shewn to warrant that assertion. The common law seems admitted to be in favor of the power of the king by all the old writers. Thé only question made has been, whether he was not restrained by statute ? We have shewn what that restraint is, and that it is nothing more than a restraint against authorizing a nuisance. Again — -it is said, that although the king may be the owner of this sort of property, by the common law, yet he is not so to every intent; that he holds the jure coronce as a *70trustee for the people, and, therefore, bannot convey to their prejudice. It is likened to the other dominions of the crown, which they assert he has no power to alienate; and they run a distinction between what the king has as king, in virtue of his prerogative, and what he holds in his own right, as private property. For example, they say that he claims the sea, bays, rivers, and shores by his prerogative, for his people, and, therefore, may not grant to their prejudice. But lands which accrue by escheat or forfeiture, say they, are his own, and he may grant them to whom he pleases. There is no kind of solidity, either in the reasoning or the distinction. • At the common law the king is not, as to his lands, a trustee for the people, and might alien the domains of the crown. 3 Cruise 14, sec. 5 ; 4 Statute at large 88. He had the same, nay a greater, power to grant than a private man. He was never restrained until after the revolution of 1688, by the statute-of Anne, (3 Cru. 565) which is confined to his lands in England, and was passed, long after our title accrued, and that statute permits the alienation for thirty-three years. By the common law, all the king’s lands belong to him jure coronœ. 6 Com. Dig. 61 (D 63). His natural character is merged in his political; ■ he can, in his own name as an individual, hold nothing; it is by his prerogative that he takes by forfeiture or escheat; he claims and owns royal fish, as they are called, by his prerogative, and yet they may be granted. 1 Black. Com. 298. In short, he is considered, by that law, as having a mere political character, and claims and holds all that he has as king, but may grant at his pleasure. Davies 152. It is palpable that this course of reasoning would go to prove that the proprietary title to lands in New Jersey is worthless. Charles acquired the main land as king; he was entitled to it only by his prerogative. If he was disabled to grant what he held as king he' could not convey a-n acre of land. But it is again asserted, that the grantee of the king, and those claiming under him, hold subject to the common right *71of fishery vested by the common law in the people. This is in truth the pivot upon which the defendant's case rests; but the principles we have established, and the cases we have produced, demolish it. We have shewn that the grant of the king passes the very title and propriety of the land and water, absolutely and without any such restriction; and that a right of several fishery passes with the soil. Where a several fishery passes, a common right of fishery cannot exist; they are utterly incompatible, for the right of several fishery is altogether exclusive. This assertion, then, is but a repetition of the fundamental position, that the king cannot grant several fishery in a navigable river. What authority has been produced? What dictum that the king’s grantee of the soil of a river holds subject to the right of fishery ? Lord Hale says, it is true, that he holds subject to the jus publicum, but he tells us what that is: it is the right of “ passage and re-passage with their goods by water,” (Har. L. T. 36,) which must not be taken from them under pretence of a royal grant. For this is the right of the people by the law of nature, rivers being great highways furnished by the great Creator for the use of the human race. Common of fishery is no more a part of the jus publicum, than common of pasturage belonging in all the tenants of a particular manor. ■ Again — it is said, that the king of England, alone, could do no act to divest the right of the people, without the aid of the other branches of the legislature, and, therefore, his grants are void, so far-as the common right of fishery is concerned. This is part of the old error the counsel for the defendant have fallen into in denying that the king is, by the common law, the true owner and proprietor of everything acquired in his regal capacity. That he is such absolute owner has been fully proved; and that he may, in all cases in which he is not restrained by statute, convey in full propriety, has also been demonstrated. No authority *72has been shewn, or can be found, to support this novel idea; it is utterly, inconsistent with the whole system of the common law, touching the prerogative of the king. It is also said, that the great object of these original grants was the settlement of the country, and that they must be construed so as best to promote that end; that the right of fishing, being a common right, must be considered as reserved to them by these grants, because it is for their benefit that it should be retained. This is a strange doctrine, as applied to grants, deeds and muniments of title to land; if it is adopted, and acted upon, and improved by modern ingenuity in the best manner for the good of the people, it will soon render such instruments of little avail to the owner. Fortunately, however’, it happens to be in direct .repugnancy to the law of the land, by which the construction of all solemn conveyances, and of the words inserted in them, have been fully settled, so as never to admit considerations of political policy in any manner to affect their legal operation. But if we could admit, for a moment, such considerations into this case, we might ask, what was the best plan to effect an actual settlement of this wilderness in the reign of Charles II. ? Surely it was, by encouraging a few men of enterprise and capital to embark in, and devote themselves to, the object. The settlers were to be brought from England, and maintained and protected here till able to take care of themselves. lienee,, the policy to encourage the immediate adventurers by most extensive grants and powers, and of leaving it to them to parcel out the lands without restriction. The duke first sold to two, who would probably never have purchased if the powers and rights of theforiginal grant from the king had been curtailed; these sold to the twelve ; they to the txoenty-four ; 'and they again to the forty-eight, on the original terms, leaving them to make their own contracts with future adventurers. And even as to the sub-purchasers, the small proprietors, surely the right now in discussion being secured *73to the landholder would be an additional inducement to substantial purchasers to fix themselves on the waters of the territory. It is further objected, that we have not been able to shew that the king of England has ever granted a right of several fishery in a navigable river since the statute of Magna Charta. If this be true, which is denied, it is because several fishery is dependent on the ownership of the soil, and because all the lands of England, especially those on their rivers and the sea shore, have been granted and parcelled out ever since the time of the Norman conquerer. England being an island, the English have been a commercial nation time out of mind, and the j urisdict-ion and property of their great rivers, from early times, has been distributed among their great corporations. Sir John Davies says, “ the city of London, by charter from the king, hath the river Thames granted to them, but because it was conceived that the soil and ground of the river did not pass by that grant, they purchased another charter, by which the king granted to them solum et fundum of the said river.” Ho does not say which of the kings gave this charter, but it is not likely that both grants were prior to Magna Charta. The case of Bulbroch v. Goodire, proves that several fishery is now hold in the Thames by individuals claiming under the corporation. 3 Bur. 1768. In 3 Chitty’s Criminal Law 974, we have an indictment for taking oysters from the oyster fishery of the borough of Lin Eeges in the county of Norfolk, within the limits and precincts of the port of Lin Eeges. This, no doubt, in the case of several fishery belonging to that corporation, as owners of the river. In Davies 155, this case is stated: “King Henry VIII. granted to Strangeways totam illam liberam piscariam vocatum the fleet in Abbotsbury, which is a bay and creek of the sea ;” and he adds, “ this was a several fishery on a branch of the sea.” The assertion is then incorrect in point of fact, and it is not doubted, but that if we had a full collection of royal *74grants to corporations and individuals'since Magna Gharta, many would be found granting the solum et fundum of navigable rivers in England. It has been further asserted, that the people have always exercised the right of taking fish ; and a grantee of the proprietors now, for the first time, has set up this pretence. There is no foundation in fact for either branch of this assertion. That the people have been in the habit of taking oysters from the unappropriated beds may be true, but that such a right has been exercised in places where the soil of the river has been sold and located is denied, and has not been proved. It is a matter of fact, and ought to have been proved. The defendant gave some evidence, that in former times, before the survey, the Woodbridge people insisted on their right, and so did the owner of our main farm insist on -his, and resist theirs; but it is well known that the Wood-bridge men claimed the right of fishing not as a right of common, but under their grant from the proprietors, commonly called the Woodbridge charter. When this action was brought, they discovered that the charter upon which they relied did not cover’this oyster-bed, and then they, for the first time', by the advice of their, learned counsel, took this new ground of common right. There is not a particle of evidence that they ever before asserted a title by general right of common fishery; on the contrary, they claimed by grant, as the plaintiff does. The people of this state exercise a right of fowling and hunting in the waste of the proprietors. Surely when the proprietors sell, and the purchaser encloses and improves, such a right could not remain; and yet that is precisely the same sort of -common right as that exercised by our adversaries in regard to fishing.- As to this being a new claim, now for the first time got-up, the documents produced should have shielded us from this reproach; we have shewn many grants of the soils of the rivers from the public records, and many more from the earliest- times no doubt exist. Is it not a notorious fact, that *75numerous fisheries have been held on all our great rivers for more than a century without dispute? Many actions of trespass have been brought in this court, and heavy damages recovered for taking fish from such several fisheries ; not merely for hauling on the land, but for taking the fish swimming in the river. The doctrine upon which this non-suit' was ordered will destroy all this species of property from Powles Hook to Gape May. It is well known that seines may be drawn without touching the land. Shad fisheries of immense value, which have been transmitted from father to son, time out of mind, are destroyed at a stroke, though the property in them has been admitted by the legislature in all their acts taxing and regulating them. The argument, then, from possession and usage, is altogether on the side of the plaintiff. This doctrine of a right of several fishery is not confined to New Jersey; it is recognized and protected in many of our sister states. In Massachusetts, the fisheries all belong to the public corporations, who distribute them out among the different towns. This proves that they were considered as passing by their charters, and that there is no right of common in those fisheries in the whole mass of the people. In Connecticut, as early as the year 1790, the Supreme Court, in the case of Adgate v. Story, determined that the adjoining proprietor might maintain trespass against one who drew a seine in a navigable river fronting his land. 1 Swift’s System 343. In Pennsylvania, it has been judicially admitted, that a several fishery might have been granted by the proprietors before the extinction of their title, or by the state since. 2 Bin. 475. The act of the legislature of Pennsylvania vesting in the commonwealth the estates of the late proprietors, grants all the soil, royalties and franchises granted by Charles II. to William Penn, and the Supreme Court, in the cases just cited, admit that the right of several fishery passed. 1 Dal. Penn. Laws 822. *76■ In Maryland, upon Lord Baltimore’s grant, it was held that the king had power- to grant several fishery, and that the forms of that grant, not so- comprehensive as ours, did convey it. The only doubt was on' a proviso reserving the common right of fishery to the people of England. Har. & M’Hen. Rep. 564. And, finally, we find the settlers in West Jersey contracting for the right of common of fishery with the proprietors, and the proprietors granting it to / them. Leaming & Spicer 390. ■ But no such grant has ever been made by the eastern proprietors, and the concession and acceptance of it shews that, in the opinion of both parties, it did not exist without it. IV. The only remaining point to be discussed is, whether the title of several fishery was surrendered and given up to Queen Anne when the proprietors yielded up to her their jurisdiction and powers of government ? This argument was delicate and dangerous, because it gives up at once all the rest of the case, admitting that the right in question did pass by the original grants to the proprietors; for if it did not exist it could not be surrendered. And here it is to be remarked, that the crown of England executed every reasonable act of further assurance to protect and enforce the grants to the proprietors while the government remained in the proprietors, as the documents laid before the court fully prove. The only trouble they met with was from the duke’s governors in Hew York. When he became king, he was too much engaged in his own plans at hojne to spend time in the affairs of his colonies; but after the revolution, and towards the latter end of the reign of William III., the British court betrayed the same disposition ■ which had before appeared in regard to other colonies, to infringe the , liberal charters which had. been first granted to the adventurers in America; and the crown lawyers began to question the validity of that part of the grant of Charles II. which conveyed the powers of government in extenso. And so many impediments to the liberal views and exertions of *77the proprietors to settle the country were thrown in the way, that they judged it most expedient to open a treaty for the surrender of the government to the crown of England, so far as related to the great political powers of government. Leaming & Spicer 588, give the propositions of the proprietors. In the 9th section it proposed that the proprietors may be lords of the soil and hold courts. Ib. 595, the answer of the board of trade is, that they have no objection to this, in case those officers bo like such as constitute the courts leet and baron in England. Ib. 590, in section 13th, the proprietors reserve all royalties, enumerating them, “to remain to the proprietors with all other privileges and advantages, as ample as in the grant and confirmation to them of the 14th March, 1682.” lb. 596, the answer of the board is, “ This article may be reasonable, except as to the goods and chattels of traitors, &c., which is matter of state;” and they add these significant words, “Nor can right accruing to the proprietors from the seas adjacent be well circumscribed.” With this protocol before us, we proceed to the final treaty, which is found in the instrument called the surrender. This instrument recites the original grants, and that the king did grant to the duke, and he to the proprietors, “ full and absolute power and authority to appoint governors, and to correct, punish, pardon, govern and rule all the adventurers, according to such laws, dfc., as the duke or his assigns should establish, with power to use and exercise martial law in case of insurrection, rebellion, or mutiny, and to make war against all persons ivho should attempt to inhabit without the leave of the duke or his assigns.” Leaming & Spicer 609, 12, 13. It then recites “ that her majesty Queen Anne had been advised that the proprietors have no power to execute any of the said powers, but that the same belonged to her majesty in right of her crown.” It further recites, “ that the proprietors, being desirous to submit themselves to her majesty, are willing to surrender *78all their pretences to the said powers of government.” Then they do surrender and yield up to the queen all these the said powers and authorities to correct, punish, pardon, govern, and rule;” and also the right to make laws and appoint .governors ; “ and also the powers to use and exercise martial law, and to make war,” &c. Is it not, then, self-evident that this deed of surrender only embraced the great • political powers of government which, as the country was becoming populous, were inconsistent with dependence on the British crown; and that it did not convey or surrender any estate, property, franchise, royalty, or privilege appertaining to the soil, rivers, and bays which entered essentially into the estimate of the value of the soil, and had become their property ? It was so understood by the queen and her council. Immediately after the' surrender, Lord Oornbury was appointed the first royal governor. He received written instructions, the 36th section of which recommends passing such laws “ as will secure the right of property of the soil to the proprietors,” and “all such privileges as were expressed in the conveyance to the duke of York, excepting only the right of government.” Leaming & Spicer 628, sec. 36. How, unless this court is prepared to pronounce that the claim of right of common of all fish is one of those great political rights which pertained essentially to the crown of England, and a part of the right of government, it cannot be within that deed of surrender. Indeed, unless the words of the deed of surrender are' disregarded as well as the manifest intent and meaning of the contracting parties, there is nothing in this objection. Kirkpatrick, C. J. This is an action of trespass for entering upon the plaintiff’s oyster-bed in the mouth of the Raritan, at Perth Amboy, and taking and carrying away his oysters there planted. It was brought to trial at the Middlesex Gircuit, in December last, when, upon the case *79made out, the plaintiff was non-suited; and upon coining in of the postea there was a rule to shew cause why that non-suit should not be set aside and a new trial granted. It appeared in evidence, upon the trial, that the plaintiff, on the 14th of February, 1814, had purchased in, and, at the time of the supposed trespass, was in possession of, a certain farm, commonly called Nevill’s farm, containing one hundred and seventy-ñvo acres, or thereabouts, lying on the river Raritan, opposite to this oyster-bed, and extending, according to the words of the deed, to the hank of the river ; that one Joseph Coddington, who had before owned and possessed the said farm, and under whom the plaintiff held, had, twenty years ago, and more, and while so in possession, staked off a part of the oyster-bed in question, and that part of it, too, from which these oysters were taken, and had, during his time there, claimed the exclusive right of taking oysters upon the bed so staked off; but the people had always disputed that right, had entered upon it, and taken oysters from it, when they pleased, and if opposed by Ooddingtou, that the strongest usually prevailed. And it further appeared, that the plaintiff, soon after he came into the possession of the said farm, staked off the present bed, being greater, but including Ooddington’s, began to plant oysters upon it, and has continued to plant more or less, at the proper seasons, every year since that time; that some of the stakes, by which it is so staked off, stand below low water mark, but that they are so slender as to oppose no obstruction to the navigation of the river, even with the smallest craft; that this bed is about fifty yards below common low water mark; the tide ebbs and flows over it; it is frequently bare at the full and change of the moon, and commonly, though not always so, in the fall and spring; that there have always been oysters upon it, as well as upon the other beds in these waters, and that the space between it and the shore is what they call a mud flat, commonly covered with water, but not a channel for vessels *80or other craft usually plying in that river. And it further appeared, that the plaintiff, on the 3d of April, 1818, by virtue of a warrant of location from the proprietors of East Jersey, caused a survey to be made for -himself there of 41.59 acres of land covered with water, including a certain survey of wharves formerly made to • one Sonmans, and leaving for his survey 35.59 acres, including the oyster-bed in question. And although it appeared, that this survey had been made before the supposed trespass, and had been approved and recorded 'in due form, yet it did not appear, that such approving and recording had been before the said trespass, the time of the recording not appearing upon the record. And it further appeared in evidence, that the defendant had entered upon the said bed, so staked off, and taken oysters there, at the time in the declaration set forth. And, indeed, it was admitted by the defendant himself, that he, together with others, had so done, but merely with a view of trying the plaintiff’s pretended right, and not with a view of injuring the bed, or taking the oysters further ,than was necessary for this purpose. Upon this state of facts, the defendant moved for a non-suit — 1. Because the plaintiff had shewn no title arising from possession only, that is, an exclusive and adverse possession. 2. Because he had shewn no title under the proprietors, it not having appeared that his survey had been approved and recorded before the supposed trespass was committed. 3. Because the proprietors themselves had no title which they could convey, even if the form of conveyance had been complete. Upon the last of these reasons the plaintiff was called. But yet, still, in shewing cause upon,this rule, the defendant’s counsel have insisted upon the first and second reasons also, against the claim of the plaintiff, which he still maintains; so that it becomes necessary to look a little into each of them in their order. And 1. As to the mere possession. This is no other way proved than by shewing the conveyance for, and the pos*81session of, the Hevi'Jl farm on the shore opposite to this oyster-bed, extending, to make the most of it, to the water’s edge only; and by shewing further, the staking off of the said bed, the planting of oysters upon it, and sometimes fishing and taking oysters there, as other people also did, the claim of exclusive right notwithstanding. How, upon this it is to be observed, that though a grant of land to a subject or citizen, bounded upon a fresh wafer stream or river not navigable, and where the tide neither ebbs nor flows, extends to the channel of such river, usque ads filum aqvsce, as they have it in our old books; yet that a grant of land bounded upon a river or other water which is navigable, and where the tide does ebb and flow, extends to tho edge of tho water only, that is to say, to high water mark, and no further. See the case of the river Banne, (Davies 152, 155); Har. L. T. 5 ; Carter v. Marcott, (Bur. 2162). All pretence of possession, therefore, in this case, as being connected with, and appurtenant to, the adjacent land, must fail. The grant for that could extend only to high water mark, and it could, therefore, carry with it no part, of tho adjacent land covered with wafer. And if the plaintiff would set up a possession founded upon the staking off the bed, planting oysters upon it, and sometimes fishing there, even if it were a subject matter that could be taken possession of in that way, that possession has not been proved to be either so complete, so exclusive, or so continued, as to establish a right against those having equal claim with himself. He pretends to no proscription, none such exists in this country; he pretends to no grant, none has even boon mentioned. He places himself in the situation ol a fisherman, who, because he has fished for many years, would claim the exclusive possession of the waters, and the exclusivo right of fishing in them. Upon the ground of possession merely, then, I think the plaintiff cannot stand. But the non-suit cannot be maintained upon this alone, because he sets up another title, *822. As to the form of the conveyance and the operation of the survey. The proprietors of East Jersey are tenants in common of the soil; their mode of severing this common estate is by issuing warrants, from time to time, to the several proprietors, according to their respective rights, authorizing them to survey, and appropriate in severalty, the quantities therein contained. Such warrant does not convey a title to the proprietor, he had that before; it only authorizes him to sever so much from the common stock, and when so severed, by the proper officer, it operates as a release to him for so much. This is the case when the proprietor locates for himself. When he sells his warrant to another, that other becomes a tenant in common with all the proprietors joro tanto, and, in the same- manner, he proceeds to convert his common, into a several right. Eegularly there is a deed of conveyance upon the transfer of this warrant for so much of the common property and that deed of conveyance, and the survey upon the warrant, is the title of the transferee. It is true, that the survey must be inspected and approved by the board of proprietors, and must be carefully entered and kept in the secretary’s office, or in the office of the surveyor general of the division, but this is for the sake of security, order, and regularity only, and is, by no means, the passing of the title. It proves; that the title has already passed, but it is not the means of passing it. It may be likened to the acknowledgement of a deed by a femme covert. Her deed cannot prevail agaihst her, unless such acknowledgement be regularly made and recorded; yet such acknowledgment does not pass the title, the deed has already done that, and it operates from the day of its date. The view which has been taken of this subject, and so much insisted upon by one of the defendant’s, counsel, I think is quite too narrow. He has placed himself upon the third section of the act of January 5,1787, “ for the limitation of suits respecting titles to lands.” That section enacts, *83 “ that a survey made, inspected, and approved by the council of proprietors, and by their order recorded in the secretary’s office, or in the surveyor general's office, shall, from and after such record is made, preclude and for ever bar such proprietors from any demand thereon, any plea of deficiency of right, or otherwise, notwithstanding.” Now this is a statute merely for the limitation of suits. It is made for the benefit of him that has the survey; if he procures it to be inspected, approved, and recorded, it is a bar against the proprietors and those holding under them; if he does not do so, it is no bar, but stands just where it did before the statute was made. The statute is not imperative upon him that has the survey to procure it to be inspected, approved, and recorded; it does not make it void in case he does not do so, but leaves it where it was before, and he loses his bar. Let us see, then, how those surveys were viewed before this statute. We shall be enabled, pretty satisfactorily, to do this, by looking into the act of March 27, 1719. In the tenth section of that act, it is enacted, “ that the surveyor-general shall hold a public office, in which shall be carefully entered and kept the surveys of all lands thereafter to be made; that such entries shall be considered as matter of record, and may be pleaded as evidence in any of the courts,” &c., hut it prescribes no time within which they shall be entered, nor does it make them, void if not so entered. In the eleventh section of the same act it is recited, “ that great inconveniences have happened by making and not recording q[ surveys, whereby many have not only got lands surveyed which have been formerly surveyed, not knowing of any former survey, but have settled, and made great improvements on the same, and have been afterwards ousted thereof;” and then it is provided, “ that surveys heretofore made shall he brought in and recorded within a certain time, or for ever after to bo void and of no effect as against succeeding surveys of the same lands duly recorded.” Now, *84if those prior surveys had been of no effect until they were approved and recorded, how could those who had settled and improved under posterior surveys be ousted by them ? or how could the evil here complained of ever have happened at all ?' and if they had effect that effect is no way impaired by this act, unless it be against posterior surveys of the same lands, duly approved and recorded. The truth is, I believe, that the survey of the • proper officers, under a warrant duly issued for that purpose, has always been considered as the act of severance; the inspecting, approving and recording, as relating back to that act; and the party surveying, as having an estate in severalty from that time. And, of course, except in the case of posterior surveys, the time of inspecting, approving and. recording has not been thought material. And, as to the mode of partition, however necessary it may have been in other cases of tenancy in common, that it should be made by deed; yet in this proprietary estate, upon locations of this kind, I believe it never has been so done. As to the form of the conveyance, therefore,, in this respect, the defendant’s objection cannot prevail. 3. As to the right of the proprietors to convey. This is the great question in the cause, and though we have taken time since last term to look into it, yet I must. confess, for myself, that I have not done so in so full and satisfactory a manner as could have been wished; and my apology must be, that during a very great part of the vacation, I have been necessarily abroad, attending to- other official duties, and during the time I had assigned to myself for this purpose, I-have been so much indisposed as not to be able very satisfactorily to attend to business of any kind. I have, nevertheless, so far looked into it as to satisfy myself of the principle that must prevail. The grant of Charles II. to the duke of York was not only of territory but of government also. It was made, not with a view to give- that territory and that government to the duke, to be enjoyed as a private estate, but with a view *85to tlie settlement of it as a great colony, to the enlargement of the British empire, and the extension of its laws and dominions. In construing this grant, therefore, we ought always to have our eye fixed upon these great objects. If we shall find some things contained in it, which by the laws of England, as well as of all other civilized countries, and even by the very law of nature itself, are declared to be the common property of all men, then, by every fair rule of construction, we are to consider these things as granted to him, as the representative of the sovereign, and as a trustee to support the title for the common use, and especially so, if we shall find that the king himself had no other dominion over them. The grant is not only of all lands, but of “ all rivers, harbors, waters, fishings, &c., and of all other royalties, so far as the king had estate, right, title or interest therein, together with full and absolute power and authority to correct, punish, pardon, govern and rule all such the subjects of the king, his heirs and successors, as should, from time to time, adventure themselves into the said territory;” and for this purpose to make statutes, ordinances, &c., provided the same should not be contrary to the laws, statutes and government of England, but saving to the inhabitants, nevertheless, the right of appeal, and to the crown the right of hearing and determining the same. The duke was to govern, but he was to govern substantially, according to the principles of the British constitution. The colonists were to bo governed by him, but, by the very words of the charter, they wore to be British subjects, and to enjoy the protection, liberty and privileges of the British government. In order to accomplish those great objects, the king selected his royal brother, and granted to him all the rights which he himself had, or could exercise in and over this great territory, saving to himself only the right of hearing appeals. Those things, therefore, which were, properly speaking, the .subjects of property, and which the king himself could divide *86and grant severally to the settlers, the duke, by virtue of this charter, could also divide and grant; but those things which were not so, and which the king could not grant, but held for the common use, the duke necessarily held for the same use, and in the same way. Let us see, then, upon what principle 'the king held the subject matter of this inquiry; what right he had in it, and how far he could dispose of it. Everything susceptible of property is considered as belonging to the nation that possesses the country, and as forming the entire mass of its wealth. But the nation does not possess all those things in the same manner. By very far the greater part of them are divided among the individuals of the nation, and become private property. Those . things not divided among the individuals still belong to the nation, and are 'called public property. Of these, again, some are reserved for the necessities of the state, and are used for the public benefit, and those are called “the domain of the crown or of the republic ; others remain common to all the citizens, who take of them and use them, each according to his necessities, and according to the laws which regulate their use, and are called common property. Of this latter kind, according to .the writers, upon the law of nature and of nations, and upon the civil law, are the air, the running water, the sea, the fish, and the wild beasts. Vattel lib. i, 20. 2 Black. Com. 14. But inasmuch as the things which constitute this common property are things in which a sort of transient usufructuary possession only can be had; and inasmuch as the title to them and to the soil by which they are supported, arid to which they are appurtenant, cannot well, according to the common law notion of title, be vested in all the people ; therefore, the wisdom of that law has placed it in the hands of the sovereign power, to be held,, protected, and regulated for the common use and benefit. But still, though this title, strictly speaking, is in the sovereign, yet the use is common to all the people. This prim *87ciple, with respect to rivers and arms of the sea, is clearly maintained in the case of the royal fishery upon the Banne, in Ireland, in Sir John Davies report of that case 56, 57, and in Hales treatise de jure maris et braehiorum ejusdum. Bracton, too, quoting from Justinian, says, “publica sunt omnia fiumina, et ports ideoque jus piscandi omnibs commune est in poriu fiuminibusque, et riparum etiam usus est publicas jure gentium, sicut et ipsius fiuminis.” Bracton lib. i, chap. 12. In Lord Pitzwalter’s case, (1 Mod. 105) it is said that in an action of trespass for fishing in a river where the tide flows and reflows, it is a good justification to say, that the locus in quo est braehiam maris in qua unusquisque subjects ÓMmini regis habet et habere debet liberara piscaría;m, for that, prima facie, the fishing is common to ail. In Warren v. Matthews, (6 Mod. 73) we are told every subject of common right may fish with lawful nets in a navigable river, as well as in the sea, and the king’s grant cannot bar him thereof. Same case (Salk. 357.) Carter v. Marcott (Bur. 2162.) In navigable rivers, the fishery is common, it is prima facie in the king, but is public and for the common use. Nothing can be more clear, therefore, than that part of the property of a nation 'which has not been divided among the individuals, and which Vattel calls public property, is divided into two kinds, one destined for the use of the nation in its aggregate national capacity, being a source of the public revenue, to defray the public expense, called the domain of the crown, and the other destined for the common use and immediate enjoyment of every individual citizen, according to his necessity, being the immediate gift of nature to all men, and, therefore, called the common properly. The title of both these, for the greater order, and, perhaps, of necessity, is placed in the hands of the sovereign power, but it is placed there for different purposes. The citizen cannot enter upon the domain of the crown and apply it, or *88■any part of it, to his immediate use. He cannot go into the .king’s forests and fall and carry away the trees, though it is the public property; it is placed in the hands of the king 'for' a different purpose, it is the domain of the crown, a source of revenue; so neither can the king intrude upon the •common property, thus understood, and appropriate it to himself, or to the fiscal purposes of the nation, the enjoyment of it is a natural Hght which cannot be infringed or taken away, unless by arbitrary power; and that, in theory ■at least, could not exist in a free government, such as England has always claimed to be. , But if this be so, it will be asked, how does it happen that in England, whose polity in this respect we are now •examining, we find not only navigable rivers, but also arms of the sea, ports, harbors and certain portions of the main sea itself upon the coasts, and all the fisheries appertaining to them, in the hands of individuals. That the fact is so, cannot be controverted; but how it became so, is not so easy, at this period of time, satisfactorily to shew. So far as it depends upon royal grant, however, it seems pretty clear, that it has always been considered as an encroachment upon the common rights of the people. An exclusive right of fishing in a navigable river, is said to be a royal franchise, that is, a privilege or branch of the royal prerogative, granted by the king to a private person. This royal prerogative, we are told, was first claimed by the crown, upon the coming in of William the conqueror, and was considered by the people to be a usurpation of their ancient common rights. Accordingly, in Magna Charta, which is said to be nothing more than a restoration of the ancient common law, we find this usurpation broken down and prohibited in future. That charter, as passed in the time of King John, enacts, “ that where the banks of rivers had first been defended in his time, (that is, when they had first been fenced in, and shut against the common use, in his time) they should be from thenceforth laid open.” And, *89""by the charter of Henry III., which is but an amplification and confirmation of the former, it is enacted, “ that no hanks shall he defended (that is, shut against the common use) from henceforth, hut such as were in defence in the time of King Henry our grandfather, by the same places and the same bounds as they were wont to be in his time.” By this charter, it has been understood, and the words fairly import, that all grants of rivers, and rights of fishery in rivers or arms of the sea, made by the kings of England before the time of Henry II., were established and confirmed, but that the right of the crown to make such royal grants, and by that means to appropriate to individuals what before was the common right of all, and the means of livelihood for all, for all future time, was wholly taken away. And whatever diversity there may be found in the books, with respect to the different kinds of fishery, it can no way affect the operation of the charter in this respect, because that forbids all manner of fencing in, or shutting, fisheries against the common use. All claim, therefore, of an exclusive right of fishery in a navigable river, founded upon the king’s grant, or prescription, which presupposes a grant, must reach as far back as Henry .IT. This we find expressly laid down by Sir William Blackstone, one of the greatest men that ever wrote upon the laws of England. 2 Black. Com. 39. Lord Chief Justice Holt, too, lays it down as a principle, “ that the king’s grant cannot bar a subject from fishing in a navigable river(6 Mod. 73 ; Salk. 357) and pretty nearly to the same effect is Mod. 105. The case of Carter v. Marcott seems to admit, that such a right can be maintained by prescription, which runs back beyond the memory of man. Bur. 2162. Against this doctrine has been cited, and much relied upon, Lord Hale’s treatise de jure mavis hrachiorumque ejusdem, given to us by Hargrave in his law tracts, and the case of the royal fishery upon the river Banne, in Ireland, by Sir John Davies. But making a little allowance for *90both the judge and the reporter being disciples of Seldon, and converts to his doctrine of the mare clausum, everything they have said may, in my view of it, be admitted in the fullest extent, and yet the positions here laid down be in no way shaken; nay, indeed, I have rather considered them as the great foundations upon which they are to rest. . Lord Hale says, “the sea, and the arms of the/sea, and the navigable rivers in which the tide ebbs and flows, are of the dominion of the king, as of his proper inheritance; and that this dominion embraces, also, the shores, litora, the spaces covered with the slime and mud deposited by the water between the high and the low'water mark, in the ordinary flow and reflow of the tide; that this dominion consists, first, in the right of jurisdiction which he exercises by his maritime courts; and, secondly, in the right of fishing in the waters ; but that though the king is the owmer of these waters, and, as consequent of his property, hath the primary right of fishing therein, yet the common people of England have regularly a liberty of fishing in the sea, and the creeks, and the arms thereof, as a public common piscary, and may not, without injury to their right, be restrained thereof.” This is his general doctrine. He then proceeds and says, that “ though the king hath this right eommuni jure, yet a subject, also, may have such right, and that either by king’s grant or prescription; that the king may grant fishing within a creek of the sea, and that he may also grant a navigable river that is an arm of the sea, with the water and soil thereof.” Rut when he speaks of this power of granting, as a common law right in the king, he must be understood as speaking of the common law before it was confined and restrained by Magna Charla, and as it was received and acted upon by the kings of England before that time; and accordingly all the grants which he has been able to produce, after the most diligent search, are before the date of that charter. He has given, in support of his doctrine, *91five grants, and five only, one by Canute the Dane ; two by William the Conqueror; one by Edward the Confessor, and one by John himself before passing of this statute. And that the law was so understood at that time, or rather so construed by arbitrary kings; that they did so grant, and that those grants were confirmed by Magna Charta, and are now the foundation of most of the several rights of fishery in England, cannot be doubted. And, besides this, Lord Hale, in his treatise, has nothing material on this subject that I can discover. In examining this subject, I do not speak of the jure regium as it is called, the right of regulation which the king has in all the navigable waters of the kingdom; that is quite another thing, and wholly foreign from the present question. Then as to the case of the Banne water in Ireland. It was this : the plaintiff had obtained a royal grant for the territory of Rout, adjoining the river Banne, in which grant was contained, among other things, pisearias, piseationes, agues, aguarum, cursus, cfe., in territoriopredicto, reserving' to the crown three parts of the said fishery. And the question was, whether this fishery passed by the grant ? and it was held, that it did not; not, indeed, upon the principle, that the king could not grant in that case, but upon the com struction of the grant. In the discussion of the case, however, it was laid down', “ that every navigable river, so far as the tide ebbs and flows, is a royal river, and that the fishery of it is a royal fishery, and belongs to the king by his prerogative ; and the reason is, that the river participates of the nature of the sea, and is said to be a branch of the sea so far as it flows; and the sea is not only under the dominion of the king, bu-t it is also his proper inheritance, and, therefore, he shall have1 the land gained out of it, and also the grand fishes of the-sea, such as whales, sturgeons, &e., which are royal fish, and no subject can have them without the king’s special grant; and he shall have the wild swans also, as royal fowls, on the sea and its branches.” *92Now what does this, taken in its whole extent, prove ? It proves, that the wisdom of the law has placed the titles of rivers, &c., in the king; that if the river shall leave its bed, ■or if otherwise, there shall be alluvions or derelictions by the waters, the land so made shall then, and not before, belong to the king, as part of his domain; and that he has an exclusive right in these waters to his royal fish and swans, but it proves no more. Nay, indeed, it does prove more, for the very position, that he has an exclusive right to the royal fish and swans, proves that he has no such right to any others. It would be absurd to contend, that he had an exclusive prerogative right to these fish and swans, if he had also the same right to all the fish in the river, and all the aquatic birds upon it. Again — it is said, in the same book, “ that, by the common law of England, a man may have a proper and several interest as well in a water or river as in a fishery ; and that, therefore, a water may be granted.” The cases produced to ■support the latter part of this position are grants from private individuals to private individuals, but even if they were from the king, it would not alter the case, for there is no doubt that many such exist; but the question is, can such a grant be made by the king since the reign of Henry II ? It is enough to say, that no instance of it has been produced. Recent confirmations of ancient grants made before that time, which are recognized and established by the charter of Henry III. prove nothing to the purpose. Upon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, as I was att the trial, that by the law of nature, which is the only true foundation of all the social rights; that by the civil law, which formerly governed almost the whole civilized world, ■and which is still the foundation of the policy of almost every nation in Europe; that by the common law of England, of which our ancestors boasted, and to which it were well if we ourselves paid a more sacred regard; I say I am of opinion, that, by all these, the navigable rivers in which *93the tide ebbs and flows, the ports, the bays, the coasts of the sea, including both the water and the land under the water, for the purpose of passing and repassing, navigation, fishing, fowling, sustenance, and all the other uses of the water and its products (a few things excepted) are common to all the citizens, and that each has a right to use them according to his necessities, subject only to the laws which, regulate that use; that the property, indeed, strictly speaking, is vested in the Sovereign, but it is vested in him not for his own use, hut for the use of the citizen, that is, for his direct and immediate enjoyment. I am of opinion, that this great principle of the common law was, in ancient times, in England gradually encroached upon and broken down; that the powerful barons, in some instances, appropriated to themselves these common rights ; that the kings themselves, also, in some instances during the same period, granted them out to their courtiers and favorites ; and that these seizures and these royal favors are the ground of all the several fisheries in England, now claimed either by prescription or by grant; that the great charter, as it is commonly called, which was nothing but a restoration of common right, though it did not annul, but confirmed, what had been thus tortiously done, yet restored again the principles of the common law, in this as well as in many other respects; and since that time no king of England has had the power of granting away these common rights, and thereby despoiling the subject of the enjoyment of them. I am of opinion, that when Charles II. took possession of this country, by his right of discovery, he took possession of it in his sovereign capacity; that he had the same right in it, and the same power over it, as he had in and over his other dominions, and no more; that this right consisted chiefly in the power of granting the soil to private citizens for the purposes of settlement and colonization, of establishing a government, of appointing a governor, of conveying to him all those things appurtenant to the sovereignty, com*94monly called royalties, for the benefit of colonists; but that he could not, and never did, so grant what is called the common property as to convert it into private property; that these royalties, therefore, which constitute that common property of which the rivers, bays, ports, and coasts of the sea were part, by the grant of King Charles, passed to the duke of York, as the governor of the province exercising the royal authority for the public benefit, and not as the proprietor of the soil, and for his own private use; and that if they passed from the duke of York to his grantees, which is a very doubtful question, then, upon the surrender of the government, as appurtenant thereto, and inseparable therefrom, they reverted to the crown of England. And I am further of opinion, that, upon the Bevolution, all these royal rights became vested in the people of New Jersey, as the sovereign of the country, and are now in their hands; and that they, having, themselves, both the legal title and the usufruct) may make such disposition of them, and such regulation concerning them, as they may think fit; that this power of disposition and regulation must be exercised by them in their sovereign capacity; that the legislature is their rightful representative in this respect, and, therefore, that the legislature, in the exercise of.this power, may lawfully erect ports, harbors, basins, docks and wharves on the coasts of the sea and in the arms thereof, and in the navigable rivers ; that they may bank off those waters and reclaim the land upon the shores; that they may build dams, locks and' bridges for the improvement of the navigation and the ease of passage; that they may clear and improve fishing places, to increase the product of the fishery; that they may create, enlarge and improve oyster-beds, by planting oysters .therein in order to procure a more ample supply; that they may do these things themselves, at the public expense, or .they may authorize others to do it by their own labor, and .at their own expense, giving them reasonable tolls, rents, profits, or exclusive and temporary enjoyments;, but still *95this power, which may be thus exercised by the sovereignty of the state, is nothing more than what is called the jus regium, the right of regulating, improving, and securing for the common benefit of every individual citizen. The sovereign power itself, therefore, cannot, consistently with the principles of the law of nature and the constitution of a well ordered society, make a direct and absolute grant of the waters of the state, divesting all the citizens of their common right. It would be a grievance which never could he long borne by a free people. From this statement, it is seen that, in my opinion, the proprietors, as such, never had, since the surrender of the government, any such right to, interest in, or power over, those waters, or the land covered by them, as that they could convey the same and convert them into private property; and that, therefore, the grant in question is void, and ought not to prevail for the benefit of the plaintiff, and, of course, that the rule to shew cause must be discharged. Eobsell J. It is a fact, as singular as it was unexpected in the jurisprudence of our state, that the taking a few bushels of oysters, alleged to be the property of the plaintiff in this suit, should involve in it questions momentous in their nature, as well as in their magnitude; calling forth the talents, learning, and industry of our bar; affecting the rights of all our citizens, and embracing, in their investigation, the laws of nations and of England, the relative rights of sovereign and subjects, as well as the municipal regulations of our own country. The plaintiff’s counsel contend, that the non-suit granted on the trial of this cause, by the Chief Justice, should be set aside, on two grounds: 1. That the locus in quo whereon these oysters were laid, was his own proper freehold, by virtue of a proprietary right duly laid thereon, returned and approved of by the council of proprietors of East Jersey, and recorded by their authorized officer, in *96consequence of which he claims a several fishery. 2. That he had purchased and planted those oysters on the spot from whence they were taken by the defendant; and as a public notice, that he, by placing them on the soil of the river Raritan, had not abandoned his property in them, he had surrounded them with small stakes. The defendant claims a right to those oysters, having taken them from a bed called an oyster-bed, situate on the river Raritan, below the common low water mark, and on which it had been usual for the people of East Jersey to fish for oysters, from the first settlement of the country. In support of the first of these .positions, the counsel for the plaintiff contend, that .Charles II. in the year 1664, granted unto his brother, the duke of York, the land, soil, seas, bays, rivers, with divers franchises, royalties, and government of New Jersey; that the duke of York granted the same, in like words and powers, to Lord Berkley and Sir George Carteret; that these, by grant, conveyed to the Earl of Perth, William Penn, and others, that part of New Jersey called East Jersey, and to Edward Billinge, that part called West Jersey, together with all the royalties,' franchises, and government, as fully as they were granted by the king to the duke'of York; and that the present proprietors of East Jersey, deriving their respective titles to-their several shares or proportions to all the unlocated soil and waters of East Jersey, by virtue of several mesne conveyances from the original proprietors, had a legal power to dispose of rights to the plaintiff to locate them on this .oyster-bed, whereon the trespass is alleged to have been committed. And it is insisted, that as- Charles II. did grant, so he had the power to grant, not only the whole soil of a newly discovered^ or conquered, country, but certain parts of his royal prerogative, as named in the grants or letters patent to and from the duke of York. In support of these positions, they cite numerous authorities. Vattel 120-5-7, see. 266, and 101, sec. 210; 2 Black. *97 Com. 15 ; 1 Ib. 264, 286 ; Davies 152; 6 Com. Dig. Navigation D 50, 60, title Prerogative; 4 Bur. 2163-4-5; 3 Cruise, sec. 14, title Deed, 565-8; 17 John. 209-10-13; 3 Term. Reports 253; 2 Bin. 475; 4 Mass. Rep. 140 ; Har. & M’Een. Rep. 564; Har. L.

From these authorities it abundantly appears, that by the law of nations and of England, a conqueror has a right to impose such laws on the conquered, as he may think proper; that in England, all property, real and personal, capable of ownership vests in some one or more individuals or bodies corporate; that the titles to lands in England are said to bo held, in general, mediately from the king; that certain rights and powers are vested in him, as the head of the government, under the name or title of prerogative, .amongst which may be numbered, on the present occasion, the sovereignty of the sea to a certain extent, and of all public rivers, royal fish, as whales and sturgeons, wrecks, treasure-trove, &c.; that the kings of England have, from time to time, frequently alienated’ part of the domains belonging to the crown, and bestowed many franchises on their favorites, and rewarded individuals, for their faithful services, with parts of their lands, or granted them many exclusive privileges, as a right to fish in arms of the sea, or public rivers wherein the sea ebbs and flows; and lastly, that King Charles II. did, in the year 1664, grant to the duke of York all the lands, islands, soils, rivers, harbors, mines, minerals, quarries, woods, marshes, waters, lakes, fishings, hawkings, huntings, fowlings, and all other royalties in, belonging, or appertaining to the state of New Jersey, as well as the government of the same (saving and reserving to the crown the receiving, hearing and determining appeals in and touching any judgment or sentence to be there made or given); to appoint governors, and to make *98all necessary laws, &c., so always that they be not contrary to the laws and statutes of England, but as near as may be agreeable thereto. After a careful examination of the authorities cited to establish the plaintiff's claim to these oysters, and his right to a several fishery on the bed whereon they were laid, I shall proceed to examine the correctness of the inferences and conclusions his counsel have drawn from those authorities. And it may not be amiss to take a very brief view here of the manner in which this country was first settled by English subjects. In the preface of Grants and Concessions by Leamning & Spicer, they say : “ The great .success of the house of Austria on this side the Atlantic, and the prodigious wealth they had drawn from their colonies, could not fail pointing out to so enterprising a people as the Britons, this as a seat of future wealth and grandeur. But the authority of a limited government, aided by the example of a few individuals, would have scarcely been sufficient to prevail on the common people to shake off that attachment inherent in all 'to their native soil, and dare an untrod ocean in search of a country they had only heard of. It was, therefore, necessary to cultivate such a spirit as should ripen them for the undertaking; in order to which, King Charles II., in 1668, granted to the duke of York the soil and government of New Jersey, who afterwards transferred the same to other proprietors, who wisely secured to the adventurers their religion, liberties, and property, by which New Jersey wasj with great rapidity, transformed from a savage wilderness to a Christian and civilized country.” These Grants and Concessions, as well as Smith's Hist, of H. J., contain many provisions, agreements, and descriptions of the country, and invitations to settlers from England. In ,the 17th section of what is called their great charter (Leaming & Spicer 395) they, the proprietors, declare that none shall be deprived or condemned of life, liberty, or estate, or *99any way hurt in his or their privileges, freedoms, or franchises, without a trial by jury. So, in page 12, they secure to the settlers all such freedoms and privileges within the said province as to his majesty’s subjects do of right belong. In page 28, the proprietors instruct their governor to especially provide for the interest, liberty, and defence of all who shall plant or inhabit the said province. In page 54, the proprietors set forth their claim to all strays of beasts at land, and all wrecks Ut sea. In page 141, in the year 1682, the duke of York confirms to the twenty-four proprietors, their heirs and assigns, as well for the planting, peopling, and improving the lands, territories, &c., all islands, bays, rivers, &c., repeating all things named in the original grant, with all his interest, claim, and demand in law or equity ; and then goes on to say, (page 148) as also the free use of all hays, rivers, and waters leading into, or lying between the said premises (of East Jersey) for navigation, free trade, falling, or otherways. This confirmation became necessary to establish the rights of the proprietors, for two reasons : 1. The Dutch had claimed a right to this country, and had for a number of years possession of New York and parts adjacent in this state, and, also, had made settlements on both sides of the Delaware. They were dispossessed thereof in 1668, by the English, under Colonel Nichols. At the expiration of the' war that followed soon after between England and the states of Holland, they were silent as to their pretensions to this country. 2. Although it might be true, that Charles II. might delegate the powers of government to an individual, and endow him with many royal franchises, it was strongly contended that the duke of York had no such power ; and more especially, it could not pass from proprietor to proprietor, in the manner this state had been convoyed. These objections were laid before the king; the proprietors wore' made acquainted with those difficulties, which occasioned them to say (Leaming & Spicer, sec. 613), “Her majesty *100hath been advised that we have no right, nor can legally execute any of the said powers, but that it belongs to her majesty, in right of her crown, to constitute governors, &c.; and, being desirous to submit ourselves to her majesty, are willing to surrender all our pretences,” &c. For a more full description of the powers of a conqueror over the conquered, Vattel, Dyer and Vaughan may be consulted. In Dyer 166, 224, and in Vaughan 281, it is laid down, “ If a king of England makes a new conquest of any country, the persons there born are his subjects, for by saving the lives of .the people he gains a property in them, and may impose on them what law he pleases. But until such laws are given, the laws and customs of the conquered country shall hold place, unless contrary to our religion, or malum in se, or are silent. In all such cases, the law of the conquering country shall prevail.” In 2 Salk. 412, where the laws of the conquered are rejected or silent, they shall be governed according to the rules of natural justice. In Ib. 166, 411-12, and in 2 Willes 7, if there be an uninhabited country found out by British subjects, as the law is their birthright wherever they go, they carry their laws with them, they are therefore governed by the laws of England. It is true, that in 1 Black. Com. 108, it is laid down,. “ That the common law of England, as such, does not extend to the American plantations.” In this he is contradicted by the authorities above stated, and a number of others of great celebrity ; by the universal understanding of all the English emigrating to this country; by the legislature of our own and several of the neighboring states; and, indeed, it appears directly opposed to his declarations in another part of the same page, where he says, “ If an uninhabited country is planted by British subjects, all the English laws applicable to their situation are immediately there in force.”' What reason can be given why a people, with the approbation of their king, sent to colonize a ceded or conquered: *101country for the benefit and aggrandizement of the mother country, should be deprived of their birthright ? why more than if they went without the king’s consent to colonize an uninhabited country from discontent at home, from whim, caprice or the advancement of their individual interests ? In conquered, or ceded countries, (which our American plantations principally are) “ that have laws of their own, the king may, indeed, alter or change those laws, until which the ancient laws of the country prevail, unless such as are against the law of God, as in an infidel country. They, the American plantations, were obtained either by conquest, as driving out the natives, or by treaties.” 1 Black Com. 108. This will not apply to New Jersey; it was never ceded, by name or description, to England, nor did wo drive out the natives, but by a peacable purchase became possessed of their rights to the soil, &c.; and that the proprietors governors, and settlers were all united in the opinion, that the common law and the laws of England were their birthright, is manifest from what has been before stated, as well as from other parts of Leaming & Spicer, Smith’s Hist. N. J., our own constitution, and decisions of our highest courts ofjudica ture. Tn the year 1680, the proprietors, protesting against a duty exacted of them by the duke of York, say, (Smith’s Hist. N. J. 118) “ If we would not assure people of an easy, free, and safe government, an uninterrupted liberty of conscience; and an inviolable possession of their civil rights and freedoms, a mere wilderness would be no encouragement.” Ib. 118—“To say, that this is a conquered country, and the king, as conqueror, has the power to make laws, raise money, &c. But suppose the king were an absolute conqueror, doth his power extend over his own English people as over the conquered ? are not they some of the letters that make up the word conqueror ? did Alexander conquer alone, or Osesar beat by himself? shall their armies of countrymen and natives lie at the same mercy as the vanquished ? The Norman duke used not the companions of his victory so ill; *102natural right and human prudence oppose such doctrine all the world oyer.” Ib. 120, our case is better yet, for the king’s grant to the duke is plainly restrictive to the laws and government of England. There are home-born rights declared to be law by statutes, as in the great' charter 29 and 34 Edward III. chap. 2. We humbly say we have not lost “ any ■part of our liberty by leaving our country, for we leave not our king or government by quitting our soil. Under favor, we buy nothing of the duke if not the right of free colonization as Englishmen with no diminution, but expectation of some increase, of those freedoms and privileges enjoyed in our country. The soil is none of his; it is the natives’ by the jus gentium, the law of nations. It would be an ill argument to convert to Christianity, to expel, instead of purchasing them out of those countries.” Ib. 190 — Governor Coxe, the greatest proprietor of West Jersey, appointed in 1687, writes thus, “I do, in my heart, highly approve of the ratified fundamentals, &c., that no person shall be deprived of life, limb, estate, privilege, freedom, franchises, without a due trial &c., as well as all other parts of the fundamentals, if it appears there is nothing in them contrary to the laws of England which extend to our colony, by the breach whereof we inevitably expose ourselves to the forfeiture of our charter.”' In 1702, Lord Cornbury was appointed governor by Queen Anne. In his address, that year, to the council and assembly, he says, “ Her majesty has commanded me to assure you of her protection upon all occasions. Under her auspicious reign, you will enjoy all the liberty and happiness that good subjects can wish for under the best laws in the universe, I mean the laws of England.” The legislature, in answer, say, “ they are satisfied that the queen will protect them in the full enjoyment of their rights, liberties and properties, and they are happy under the government of the greatest queen and the best of laws,” &c. Ib. 414 — In 1720, Governor Burnet was appointed, and addressed the legislature, he *103congratulates them on the accession of George I. “to which,” he adds, “ you owe the preservation of your laws and liberties.” Ib. 560—In 1699, the proprietors of East Jersey, in a memorial to the lords commissioners of trade and plantations, oiler to surrender the government to the king, towards which, they say, they enumerate the following particulars :— “First, that his majesty would confirm to them the soil and lands.” And in the 13th article — -“all lands, goods and chattels of felons, &c., treasure-trove, mines and minerals, royal mines, wrecks, royal fish that shall be forfeited, found, or taken within East Jersey, or within the seas adjacent, to remain to the proprietors,” &c. Ib. 572 — This not succeeding, in 1701, the proprietors of East and West Jersey presented another memorial, the 14th section of which says, “ That all such further privileges, franchises and liberties, as upon consideration, shall be found necessary for the good government and prosperity of the said province, and increasing the trade, may be granted to the proprietors.” Leam & Spi. 681—In 1680, “As we are the representatives of the freeholders of this province, we dare not grant his majesty’s patent, though under the great seal of England, to be our rule; for the great charter of England, alias Magna Charta, are the only rules of privilege and safety of every free-born Englishman.” Thus our fore-fathers, bringing with them so much of the common law of Great Britain as was applicable to their change of situation, settled New Jersey, claiming, as their birthright, all the liberties enjoyed in their native land, with the addition of a number of privileges granted them by the proprietors, as an encouragement to them, and as a benefit to both. As to the right of Charles II. to grant the sea, bays, rivers, fisheries, and other royal franchises in such manner as to now vest, by a string of conveyances from subject to subject, a several fishery in the plaintiff, as contended for by *104his counsel. Dav. 150, 152; Bur. 2164; 3 Cruise 170, Franchise, sec. 68; Salk. 637, and Esp. Dig.pt. i, 270, are relied on as supporting that position. In the case of the royal fishery of the river Banne, in Ireland, it was resolved by the court there — “ 1. That a man'may have a proper and .several fishery as well in a water or river as in a fishery, and, therefore, a water may be granted. 2. There are two kinds of rivers, navigable and not navigable. Every navigable river,, so far as the sea ebbs and flows, is a royal river, and the fishery of it is a royal fishery, and belongs to the king by his prerogative. But in every other river not navigable, and in the fishery of such rivers, the ter-tenants on each side have an interest of common right. The reason for which the king hath an interest in such navigable river, so high as the sea flows and ebbs in it, is because such river participates of the nature of the sea, and is .said to be a branch of the sea. The sea is not only under the dominion of the king, but is his proper‘inheritance, and, therefore, the king shall have the land which is gained of the sea, also the grand fishes of the sea, as whales and sturgeons, which are royal fishes, and no subject can have them without the king’s special grant, for the king ought of right to save and defend his realm, as well against the sea as against his enemies. The commission of sewers was awarded by the king, by virtue of his prerogative, and extends to not only walls and banks of the sea but also to navigable rivers and fresh waters. In statute 25, Henry VIII. the king, by reason of his prerogative, ought to provide that navigable streams be made passable. 3. The city of London, by charter from the king, had the river Thames granted to them. But because it was conceived that the soil and ground of the river did not- pass by the grant, they purchased another charter, by which the king granted them solum et fundum of the said river, by force of which the city receives rents of those who fix. posts or wharves on the soil of said river; and although the king permits people to have passage over such *105rivers, he hath the sole interest in the soil, and also in the fishery, although the profit of it is not commonly taken b.y him if it is not of extraordinary and certain value, as the fishery of the Banne hath at all times been. Wherefore it was resolved, that the river Banne, so far as the sea flows and ebbs in it, is a royal river, and the fishery of salmon there is a royal fishery, which belongs to the king as a several fishery, and not to those who have the soil on each side the water. On the other hand, it was agreed, that every inland river not navigable appertains to the owners of the soil where it has its course.” 3. That no part of this royal fishery of the Banne could pass by the grant of lands adjoining by the general grant of ■all fisheries. This is a fishery in gross, and a parcel of the inheritance of the crown by itself. The case itself also states, that in this river, Banne, there was a rich fishery of salmon, which was parcel of the ancient inheritance of the crown, as appeals by the pipe-rolls and surveys, where it was found in charge of the officers of the pipe office as a several fishery, and was granted to the city of London in fee farm. This was intruded on and shared amongst the Irish lords, who took possession by strong hand, and held it a long time. The king granted, by letters patent to Sir Pmndal M’Lonald, a parcel of the county of Antrim, adjoining the river Banne, where the fishery is, together with all waters, fish and fisheries within the said territory. And the question before the court was, whether the grant included any part of this fishery ? which was determined in the negative, on the ground, that it was a several fishery belonging to the crown, as a parcel of its ancient inheritance, which was proved by several pipe-rolls and surveys, and was in charge of the officers of the pipe office. It was also let in fee farm, the mode by which the lands attached to the crown were generally held by the tenants of the crown. Nor do I see how else it could be called a royal fishery, and salmon royal fish, which is in the same book, as well as in many others, *106•confined to whales and sturgeons. The same book, 111-12, in another case of tanistry, says, “the king, as conqueror of Ireland, has possession of all lands which he willeth to seize and retain in his own hands, for his profit or pleasure. And where the natives of a conquered country are received under the protection of the conqueror, and are permitted to retain their possessions, their heirs shall be adjudged in a good •title, without grant or confirmation, according to the rules of law there established.” Salkeld, Espinasse, and other authorities, cite the case from Davies of the river Banne, as supporting the doctrine they hold. 2 Cruise 278 — “ A franchise is a branch of the royal prerogative, subsisting in the hands of a subject by grant from the king, annexed to manors and the right to hold courts leet, to have waifs, wrecks, royal fish, which consist of whales and sturgeons.” So in lb. 297 — “ A free fishery, or exclusive right of fishing in a public river, is a royal franchise, which is now frequently vested in private persons, either by grant from the crown or by prescription.” But he adds — “ This right was probably first claimed by the crown upon the establishment of the Dormans, and was deemed by the people a usurpation.” In 4 Bur. 2162, it was declared as the opinion of the whole court, that one might prescribe for a several fishery, parcel of a manor, where the sea flows and reflows, but he must prove a right by prescription, the presumption is against him. In navigable rivers, where the sea flows and reflows, the right of fishing is common. And Lord Mansfield adds — “ The rule of law is uniform, in rivers not navigable, the proprietors of the land have the right of fishery on their respective sides ; but in navigable rivers they have it not, the fishery is common.” In 1 and 2 Modern, Lord Hale says — "" In case of private rivers, the lords having the soil is good evidence to prove he hath the right of fishing, and it puts, the proof on them who claim liberam piscariam. But in case of a river that flows *107and reflows prima, facia it is common to all. If any claim it to himself, the proof lieth on his side; and it is a good justification to say, the locus in quo is a branch of the sea, and that the subjects of the king are entitled to a free fishery. The soil of the Severn, with particular restraint, as gurgites, is in the lords, and a special kind of fishing, but the common kind of fishing is common to all. The soil of the Thames is in the king; the Lord Mayor is conservator of the river, and it is common to all fishermen; therefore there is no such contradiction betwixt the soil being in one, and yet the river being common to all fishers.” 5 and 6 Comyns, titles Navigation and Prescription, These authorities, and others relied on by the plaintiff, cite the ancient authority of Davies and the river Banne in support of the doctrines they establish. On the part of the defendant, has been cited 1 Salkeld 357. Lord Holt says, “ the subject has a right to fish in all navigable rivers as he has in the sea.” 6 Mod. 73—“ Every subject of common right may fish with lawful nets in the navigable rivers, and the king's grant cannot bar them thereof. The crown only has a right to royal fish, and that only, the king may grant.” In Lord Pay. 725 — “The public are, at common law, entitled to towing paths on the banks of navigable rivers.” 2 Black. 39 — “ A free fishery, or exclusive right of fishing in a public river, is a royal franchise, and is considered as such in all countries where the feudal polity has prevailed; though the making such grant, and by that means appropriating what it seems unnatural to restrain, the use of running water was prohibited for the future by king John’s great charter, so that a franchise of free fishery ought now to be, at least, as old as the reign of Henry II.” In 4 Black. 423-4 — “ King John, and after-wards his son Henry III. consented to the two famous charters of English liberties, Magna Charta and charta de foresta, by which care was taken to protect the subject against oppression, and every individual of the nation in *108the free enjoyment of his life, his liberty, and his property, prohibited for the future the grants of exclusive fisheries, and the erection of new bridges oppressive to the neighborhood.” The same doctrine is recognized in Espinasse, in Jacob’s L. D. and other writers on this subject. 5 Bac. Abr. 494, title Prerogative — “ The king’s prerogative is part of the law of England, and is a word of large extent, including all the rights and privileges which by law the king hath as head of the commonwealth, entrusted with the execution of the laws ; for as they maintain his safety, power, and dignity, so they likewise declare the rights and liberties of the subject. Hence it is an established rule, that all prerogatives must be for the advancement and good of the people, otherwise they should not be allowed by law. The sovereignty is in the parliament, of which the king is only a part; but, as executive magistrate, he is clothed with great powers, all intended for the good of the people, none to their detriment, nor can any prerogative be legally so employed. And it is .to answer the ends of government, and for the good of the people by a fiction of law he is considered the universal occupant of all lands; not that the people held their lands by any actual royal grant.” Ib. 156-7— “ So the king has sovereign dominion in all seas and great rivers, and a right to the fisheries and to the soil, so that if a river, so far as there is a flux of the sea, leaves its channel it belongs to the king, who protects his subject's from pirates, and provides for the security of trade and navigation. But notwithstanding the king’s prerogative in seas and navigable rivers, yet it hath been' always held,'that a subject may fish in the sea, which being a matter of common right, and the means of livelihood, and for the good of the commonwealth, cannot be restrained by grant or prescription. Also, of common right, with lawful nets in navigable rivers, as well as in the sea, and the king’s grant cannot bar them thereof, except royal whales and sturgeons, in which he has a right as a perpetual sign of his dominion, and which only he may grant.” *109 Ib. 205 — “ It seems clearly agreed, that the king may alien, grant, or change any branch of his revenue in which he has an estate of inheritance, as also his lands in fee simple, though seized of them as jure coronen. This power is founded on reasons of state, as he cannot raise money on the subject without an act of parliament. If he had not the power of aliening his lands, the kingdom might suffer from sudden invasion,” &c. 4 Comyns, Grant E—“By the grant of a piscary, the soil or water does not pass. By a grant of water, the soil does not pass. The king, by his grant, cannot alter the law in any respect, nor dispense with things in which the subject hath an interest, or change the common law by charter or Magna Charta, which is incorporated into the common law.” 6 Comyns, title Prerogative D 7; Ib. D 49—“ Every navigable river, as high as the sea flows, belongs to the king, but every one may fish in the sea of common right.” On comparing all the above authorities, and the reasons oil which they are founded, we are compelled to acknowledge, that although the kings of England formerly may have lavished on favorites, or rewarded the service of individuals with many franchises entrusted to them for the' public benefit, yet the people ever considered it as a violation of good faith, an unlawful infringement of their common rights, and as destructive alike to their liberties and their interest; until the evil increasing beyond endurance, they, sword in hand, forced from their kings the most solemn and public declaration of their rights in Magna G harta. 1 Black. Com. 128—“ The absolute rights of every Englishman, as they are founded on nature and reason, so they are coeval with our form of government. At some times we have seen them oppressed by overbearing and tyrannical princes; at others, so luxuriant as even to tend to anarchy. But the vigor of our free constitution has always delivered *110the nation, and the balance of our rights and liberties has settled to its proper level, and their fundamental articles asserted in parliament: first, by the great charter of our liberties obtained from king John ; afterwards, its confirmation,” &c. If we add to all these the conduct pursued by the proprietors themselves in the first settlement of New Jersey, by favorable and public descriptions of the country, and by letters to individuals to induce their fellow subjects to settle here, we shall be more and more convinced that the claim of the plaintiff to the exclusive right of this fishery is without legal foundation. In Smith’s History of New Jersey we find the proprietors, in 1683, sent over Thomas Budyard as their deputy governor of East Jersey. In May, the same year, he writes from thence, page 168 — “We have one thing more particular here, which is vast oyster-banks, which is constant fresh victuals during the winter to English as well as Indians; of these there are many all along our coasts,, from the sea as high as against New York, where they come and fetch them.” Ib. 170—“ Upon our view and survey of Amboy point, we find it extraordinary well situate for a great town. At low water mark, round about the point, are oysters of two kinds, some as small as English, and others two or three mouthfuls, exceeding good. We have .store of clams, esteemed much better, than oysters, and fish we have a very great store. Sea-nets are good merchandise here.” S. Groom, another proprietor, and surveyor-general, writes from'Amboy, 1781, page 174 — “The Indians come thither to get fish, fowl, oysters, clams, &c., as people go to market.” Gawen Lawrie, a deputy governor for East Jersey, writes from Elizabeth Town, and, in page 177, says — “-Pork and beef at two pence per pound; fish and fowl plenty; oysters, I think, would serve all England.” Again, in page 180— “ There is a great plenty of oysters, fish, and fowl.” *111In page 187, three of the proprietors give a particular description of East Jersey, and say — “There are no fishermen that follow only that trade, save some that go a whaling upon the coast; and for other fish, there is abundance l.o be had everywhere through the country, in all rivers, and the people, with sieves, catch one or two barrels a day for their own use and to sell to others.” In page 541, the proprietors describe the country, and invite settlers thus : — “ It is likewise proper for such who are inclined to fishing, the whole coast and very harbors’ mouths being fit for it, which has been no small rise to the New England people, and may be carried on with great advantage, The Indians catch fish, and sell at a less price than the value of time an Englishman must spend in taking them.” As early as 1718, (Nevill’s Laws 86) is found “An act for the preservation of oysters : — Sec. 1. Whereas it is found that the oyster-beds within this province are wasted and destroyed, the preservation of which will tend to the great benefit of the poor people and others inhabiting this province, all persons are prohibited from raking or gathering oysters from off any beds in this province from the 10th of May to the 10th of September; and that no person, at any time, should carry them away in any boat or vessel not wholly owned by a person living within the province.” And in this way others wrote to their friends, and in no part of the many public or private communications of the proprietors or inhabitants do we see even a hint that the navigable rivers of New Jersey were considered in any other point of view than, to use their own words, “ inlets •which God and nature formed ” as the highway to the country, or the fisheries as anything more than as the rich provision of the same bountiful Creator for the common use and benefit of the settlers. The proprietors were men who understood their rights, and were fearless in the defence of them. If those who twice purchased New Jersey; who *112braved the dangers of an immense ocean; shared in the toils, sufferings, and privations of the first settlers; who-claimed all strays by land, and wrecks by sea, in virtue of their grants, and never for a moment conceived that these grants swallowed up what, by the law of the land they left, had ever been considered the common rights of Englishmen : shall we, after a lapse of almost three centuries, insult the-memory of the men who were an ornament to the human race, whose virtues have highly exalted their names, and whose labors have been a blessing to the world, by saying they knew nothing of their privileges, and that their birthrights were-lost forever in the forests of New Jersey; that their boasted Magna Charta was a farce from which they could derive no-benefit ; and that liberty, which they so highly valued, was confined to the grants and concessions? or that our legislatures from time to time taking upon them to regulate fisheries of oysters as well as of floating fish for the public benefit,, were totally ignorant of their powers, overstepped the bounds prescribed by the constitution to the destruction of the rights and interests of individuals ? I think not. The-foregoing facts speaks strong language, and impress the mind more forcibly than volumes of abstruse and theoretical reasoning; and, on a careful examination of the whole subject, I am of opinion, that the plaintiff had no such property in the oyster-bed in question by laying a proprietary thereon, as to give him an exclusive right to the oyster fishery there. On the second point. I think that question has been decided by this court in the case of Shepard & Layton, v. Leverson (1 Pen. 391), and although I differed from my brethren in their view and determination of that case,, respect for their opinions prevents a wish, on my part, to-shake that determination. The Chief Justice there says — - “ That in a common fishery, no man can appropriate to himself any particular shoal, bed or spot, to the exclusion of others. That the planting these oysters was returning them to their proper element to mix with their kind, and was, in contemplation of law, a complete abandonment.” *113Justice Pennington says — ■“ It is admitted, that the plaintiff planted a quantity of oysters in a public navigable river, or highway, where the tide ebbed and flowed, and in which fish and oysters were taken, as of right; that there were no oysters to be found at that particular spot at the time of planting. Now although there may not have been any oysters on the particular spot where the oysters were put down, at the time of doing it, yet there may have grown oysters there since, in which case he would not be entitled to all the oysters found in the same bed. This case would resemble ’the case of a stranger voluntarily throwing his grain or money into my heap, when, from the difficulty of separation, caused by his own folly, I would be entitled to the whole.” But the present case does not present as fair a claim to the verdict of a jury, or the judgment of a court, as the one from, Monmouth. There it was admitted, that the oysters were placed on a part of the bed of the river where no oysters grew. Here they were confessedly placed on an old and frequented oyscor-bed. If returning oysters into their natural element, the river, oven if no oysters grew in that particular spot, and the mere possibility of a future increase, was such an abandonment of the right of ownership as to justify the taking them, in the opinion of the court, surely there can be no pretence for saying, that placing them in that element where oysters had grown for ages, was not, in contemplation of law, a complete abandonment of the plaintiff’s right. On much consideration of this case, I am of the opinion, that the plain tin,’ should take nothing by his motion. Therefore, let the rule to shew cause be discharged. His honor, Judge Ford had made up an opinion concurring with his brethren, but did not deliver it at large."
4,Astor v. Winter (La. 1820) 232 n. 51,," delivered the opinion of the court.* This is a suit of attachment, in which the plaintiff claims a debt, as set forth in his petition, and requires that the defendant should be compelled to accept an inheritance, descended to him by the death of his son Samuel, or that he, the creditor, on his refusal, should be authorised to accept it in his name and stead. The prayer for an attachment is confined to a credit of the defendant, in the hands of E. Livingston. The object of the action is to obtain the benefit secured to creditors, by the 83d and 92d articles of the Code, on the subject of accepting *203or renouncing successions, and the prayer for an attachment is intended to give jurisdiction to the court ; the defendant being an inhabitant of another state, where an ordinary process of citation could not reach him. So far as it relates to the credit, attached in the hands of the garnishee, it is clear that before service of the attachment, the defendant had legally assigned it over to other persons, and it was not then liable to be attached as his property, and did not afford means to the court of jurisdiction in the cause. The petition states the testament of Samuel Winter, the son of the defendant, sets forth the legal claim and right of the father to one third of the succession as forced heir ; although the whole had been willed away by the testator, and prays that his executors should be enjoined from disposing of the estate, as directed by his will. In pursuance of this prayer, an injunction was allowed by the judge of the court o quo ; and a writ of attachment having issued in general terms was served on the executors and all the property of the defendant in their possession was attached. Admitting that the court had no jurisdiction by the levy of the attachment on the credit in. the hands of Livingston ; it is contended on the *204part of the plaintiff “ that the defendant being forced heir to his son is seized de plein droit, and of course that the succession is a property liable to attachment.” The provisions of the code, which authorise the creditors of an insolvent debtor to accept an inheritance, which the latter may have fraudulently renounced to their prejudice, are so evidently just and equitable, that the court perhaps, in its anxiety to give them effect, did not allow, on the first hearing of the cause sufficient importance to the objection of the defendant, made to the jurisdiction of the court below ; on the ground of the attachment being limited to a specific credit, which had ceased to exist at the time of levying it. Being of opinion that the district court was correct, in considering the execution of the writ of attachment, beyond the prayer of the plaintiff’s petition, as irregular and void, it is unnecessary to investigate the question whether or no, forced heirs are seized of an inheritance in such a manner, as to subject it to be attached by their creditors, before acceptance. We would only remark that it is one of considerable difficulty in its solution, and that perhaps some further legislative provisions would he necessary to enable our courts to carry into effect the articles of the code above cit*205ed, in cases like the present where ordinary process cannot reach the heir. If the suit is not sustained by the proceedings on the attachment, it is clear that no legal measures have been taken to compel the appearance of the defendant. The answer of a person appointed by the court does not cure the defect in the levy of the attachment, which so far from waiving, he pleads in opposition to the jurisdiction assumed in the cause. The eighth article of the code on the subject of curatorship of absent persons is relied on by the appellant’s counsel, as giving authority to the judge of the district court, to appoint a defender for the appellee, and that, in consequence of such appointment, he was brought legally before the court to have his rights decided on. We believe that this rule is not applicable to cases like the present, which is a suit instituted directly against the absent person, not one pending before the court, in which his rights and claims may be involved. This view of the case precludes the necessity of enquiring into any of the other matters offered for consideration. It is, therefore, ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the judgment of the court a quo be affirmed with costs."
5,Adams v. People (N.Y. 1848) 232 n. 43,True,"GARDINER, J. No attempt was made upon the argument to controvert the reasoning of the learned Judge who delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court upon the premises assumed by him. It was however insisted, that the authority to punish on account of crimes committed within the jurisdiction of this State, depended upon the right of the State to the obedience of the criminal, and that the authority upon the one hand and the duty upon the other, was founded upon  the allegiance permanent or temporary, which the offender owed to the country within which the crime was committed. It was therefore admitted that a crime had been committed within this State and through the instrumentality of the defendant, and the authority of the numerous cases cited to establish the position, the actual presence of the offender at the place where the crime was consummated was not necessary to make him amenable to the law, was also conceded; but it was urged that they were adjudications in cases between sovereign and subject in reference to the municipal law of the country in which they arose, and that they did not touch the great question of allegiance which was anterior and paramount to any municipal regulation. No direct authority was referred to establishing this doctrine. We must therefore consider it as it was argued, as a question depending upon general principles. Allegiance binds the citizen to the observance of all laws which are promulgated by his own sovereign, not inconsistent with the laws of nature. The laws of nature as they are denominated also rightfully require obedience, not by reason of allegiance, but because they emanate from a higher authority than any human government. They are written upon the hearts of all men; exist before governments are organized; anterior of course to allegiance, ""and are binding all over the globe, in all countries and at all times."" To these laws all men owe obedience, not because they are subjects, but because they are men. Allegiance itself is modified and controlled by them. Every political and civil power has its legal limits, no man is bound to do any act contrary to the law of nature at the bidding of his sovereign. ( Vattel. B., 1 Ch. 4 § 53-4.) The positive regulations of particular communities, such as their revenue and usury laws, indeed the whole class of regulations which render acts in themselves indifferent, criminal by prohibition, may to some extent derive their obligation from the doctrine of allegiance — and may therefore be binding only upon the citizens and residents of that community. But this is not so in reference to the higher laws to which I have adverted. The duty of obedience does not depend upon the allegiance of the subject, or the laws of his sovereign, bnt is assumed as pre-existing. The citizen of Massachusetts who should murder an inhabitant of this State by the discharge of a loaded pistol or by striking with a deadly weapon across the invisible line which separates the territory of the two States, would transgress a law universally binding and recognized as such by the citizens of both States. If it be admitted as contended for by the counsel for the prisoner that the offender would not violate his allegiance to his own State, he would not be the less guilty on that account. He would, notwithstanding, infringe a law he was under an obligation to obey, at all times and in all places, in New York as well as in Massachusetts. In a word, where the law of nature prohibits an act as criminal, it is the province of the municipal law of each State to prescribe the means by which the crime is to be ascertained and the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender. This right is indispensable to enable a State to discharge the duty of protecting its own citizens. It is also exclusive: ""The jurisdiction of a nation within its own territory,"" says Chief Justice Marshall, ""is necessarily exclusive and absolute and the jurisdiction of its Courts is a branch of that sovereignty."" If a citizen is injured in his person or property by a foreign government or their avowed agents, redress may be sought through his own sovereign, and if refused it would be a cause for war. But when the injury arises from the fraud or malice of a private citizen, with whom or his acts his government has no connection, and the offence is consummated in the State of which the aggrieved party is a subject, no protection can be afforded except by the punishment of the offender if found within its limits. The aggrieved person cannot make reprisals, and the government of the offender is no more responsible for the tortious act of a private citizen than for his contracts. Protection therefore the ""return"" or  consideration upon the part of the State for the obedience of the subject, cannot be secured at all upon the assumption that allegiance is the only ground of jurisdiction over the criminal. The right to punish therefore it is believed, obtains in all cases where a law has been violated to which the offender owes obedience; and secondly, where the offence is committed within the territory of the State claiming jurisdiction. Piracy which is sometimes claimed as an exception, only confirms the general rule. Piracy is an offence against the law of nature, which is in this respect the law of nations. ( Story's Comm. 3 Vol. Chap. 22 § 1153.) A pirate who is one by the law of nations may be punished in any country where he may be found. Why? Because he has transgressed a law which he was bound to obey; and secondly, because the offence was committed in a place in which all nations have a common right, but over which no one has exclusive jurisdiction. Each nation therefore must have the right to punish or none; and the right is conferred upon each to prevent the escape of the offender. Allegiance to a particular power, so far from drawing after it the exclusive jurisdiction to try and punish, is not even one of the elements necessary to confer it. A Pirate born in England where the crime is recognized and punished by the common law, (4 Black. Comm. 72) may be convicted and sentenced in the Courts of the United States or those of any other nation. If a State may punish a foreigner who owes it no allegiance for acts committed on the highway of nations, there would seem to be no doubt of its jurisdiction when the offence was committed by any means within its own territory. Robbery upon land is as much opposed to the law of nature, as robbery upon the high seas. In each case the individual forfeits the protection of his government, and the difference of jurisdiction in the two cases is attributable to the right of domain, and not to the doctrine of allegiance. Vattel says that ""the sovereign who is injured by the subjects of another nation, takes satisfaction for the offence himself when he meets  with the delinquents in his own territory, or in a free place as the open sea."" ( Book 4, Ch. 4, § 52.) And again, after remarking that it would be unjust to impute to the sovereign every fault committed by a subject against a citizen of another country, he says, ""if the offended State has in her power the individual who has done the injury, she may, without scruple, bring him to justice and punishment."" ( Book 2, Ch. 6, § 75.) In this case the prisoner admits that by means of false pretences, and with an intent feloniously to cheat and defraud, he obtained, from citizens of this State, the sum of $28,000 through the instrumentality of innocent agents. And it appears that afterwards he voluntarily came within the territory of the State where the crime was committed. I think he may be rightfully punished. He has violated a law to which he owed obedience, for it was written upon his own conscience, and obligatory every where. To that law the statute of this State has affixed a penalty, to be enforced in her own tribunals for the protection of her own citizens. The immunity he enjoyed at home from arrest and punishment, was not due to him as a criminal, or as a citizen of Ohio, but because he had injured no one whom that State was bound to protect, and because the inviolability of its territory was an essential to its sovereignty and independence. The prisoner knew that through his agent he was defrauding those who were entitled to the protection of our laws, and he cannot be permitted to say that he did not know that it was unlawful to cheat in New York as well as in Ohio. BRONSON, J. As I have not found time to write out an opinion, I shall content myself with stating the conclusions at which I have arrived. That a crime has been committed within this State, and by the defendant is not denied by his counsel. But they insist that he cannot be punished here, because he was a citizen of Ohio, and owned no allegiance to this State. I am of opinion that it is not a matter of any importance whether the defendant owed allegiance to this State or not. It does not  occur to me that there are more than two cases where the question of allegiance can have anything to do with a criminal prosecution. First, where the accused is charged with a breach of the duty of allegiance, as in cases of treason; and second, where the government proposes to punish offences committed by its own citizens beyond the territorial limits of the State. When the offence, not being treason, is committed within this State, the question of allegiance has nothing to do with the matter. It is not necessary to notice the peculiar relation which a citizen of one of the United States sustains to the other States; for if a subject to the British Crown, while standing on British soil in Canada, should kill a man in this State, by shooting or other means, I entertain no doubt that he would be subject to punishment here, whenever our courts could get jurisdiction over his person. This leads me to say, that it is not necessary to inquire how the criminal can be arrested or whether he can be arrested at all. If our courts cannot get jurisdiction over his person, they cannot try him. But that is no more than happens when a citizen, who has committed an offence within the State, escapes, and cannot be found. Jurisdiction of the offence, or subject matter, and jurisdiction to try the offender, are very different things. The first exists whenever the ofence was committed within this State; and the second, when the offender is brought into Court, and not before. And this is so, whether he be a citizen or not. I am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed."
6,Alden v. Maine (U.S. 1999) 181 n. 2,False,"Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. 1 In 1992, petitioners, a group of probation officers, filed suit against their employer, the State of Maine, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The officers alleged the State had violated the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 201 et seq., and sought compensation and liquidated damages. While the suit was pending, this Court decided Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), which made it clear that Congress lacks power under Article I to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity from suits commenced or prosecuted in the federal courts. Upon consideration of Seminole Tribe, the District Court dismissed petitioners' action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Mills v. Maine, 118 F. 3d 37 (CA1 1997). Petitioners then filed the same action in state court. The state trial court dismissed the suit on the basis of sovereign immunity, and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed. 715 A. 2d 172 (1998). 2 The Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision conflicts with the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, Jacoby v. Arkansas Dept. of Ed., 331 Ark. 508, 962 S. W. 2d 773 (1998), and calls into question the constitutionality of the provisions of the FLSA purporting to authorize private actions against States in their own courts without regard for consent, see 29 U. S. C. §§ 216(b), 203(x). In light of the importance of the question presented and the conflict between the courts, we granted certiorari. 525 U. S. ___ (1998). The United States intervened as a petitioner to defend the statute. 3 We hold that the powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts. We decide as well that the State of Maine has not consented to suits for overtime pay and liquidated damages under the FLSA. On these premises we affirm the judgment sustaining dismissal of the suit. 4 * The Eleventh Amendment makes explicit reference to the States' immunity from suits ""commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."" U. S. Const., Amdt. 11. We have, as a result, sometimes referred to the States' immunity from suit as ""Eleventh Amendment immunity."" The phrase is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the Eleventh Amendment. Rather, as the Constitution's structure, and its history, and the authoritative interpretations by this Court make clear, the States' immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today (either literally or by virtue of their admission into the Union upon an equal footing with the other States) except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments. 5 * Although the Constitution establishes a National Government with broad, often plenary authority over matters within its recognized competence, the founding document ""specifically recognizes the States as sovereign entities."" Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, supra, at 71, n. 15; accord, Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991) (""[T]he States entered the federal system with their sovereignty intact""). Various textual provisions of the Constitution assume the States' continued existence and active participation in the fundamental processes of governance. See Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 919 (1997) (citing Art. III, § 2; Art. IV, §§ 2-4; Art. V). The limited and enumerated powers granted to the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches of the National Government, moreover, underscore the vital role reserved to the States by the constitutional design, see, e.g., Art. I, § 8; Art. II, §§ 2-3; Art. III, § 2. Any doubt regarding the constitutional role of the States assovereign entities is removed by the Tenth Amendment, which, like the other provisions of the Bill of Rights, was enacted to allay lingering concerns about the extent of the national power. The Amendment confirms the promise implicit in the original document: ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."" U. S. Const., Amdt. 10; see also Printz, supra, at 919; New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 156-159, 177 (1992). 6 The federal system established by our Constitution preserves the sovereign status of the States in two ways. First, it reserves to them a substantial portion of the Nation's primary sovereignty, together with the dignity and essential attributes inhering in that status. The States ""form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere."" The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). 7 Second, even as to matters within the competence of the National Government, the constitutional design secures the founding generation's rejection of ""the concept of a central government that would act upon and through the States"" in favor of ""a system in which the State and Federal Governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people--who were, in Hamilton's words, `the only proper objects of government.' "" Printz, supra, at 919-920 (quoting The Federalist No. 15, at 109); accord, New York, supra, at 166 (""The Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States""). In this the founders achieved a deliberate departure from the Articles of Confederation: Experience under the Articles had ""exploded on all hands"" the ""practicality of making laws, with coercive sanctions, for the States as political bodies."" 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 9 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (J. Madison); accord, The Federalist No. 20, at 138 (J. Madison & A. Hamilton); 3 Annals of America 249 (1976) (J. Iredell). 8 The States thus retain ""a residuary and inviolable sovereignty."" The Federalist No. 39, at 245. They are not relegated to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, but retain the dignity, though not the full authority, of sovereignty. B 9 The generation that designed and adopted our federal system considered immunity from private suits central to sovereign dignity. When the Constitution was ratified, it was well established in English law that the Crown could not be sued without consent in its own courts. See Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 437-446 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting) (surveyerrng English practice); cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 414 (1979) (""The immunity of a truly independent sovereign from suit in its own courts has been enjoyed as a matter of absolute right for centuries. Only the sovereign's own consent could qualify the absolute character of that immunity""). In reciting the prerogatives of the Crown, Blackstone--whose works constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation--underscored the close and necessary relationship understood to exist between sovereignty and immunity from suit: 10 ""And, first, the law ascribes to the king the attribute of sovereignty, or pre-eminence... . Hence it is, that no suit or action can be brought against the king, even in civil matters, because no court can have jurisdiction over him. For all jurisdiction implies superiority of power... ."" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 234-235 (1765). 11 Although the American people had rejected other aspects of English political theory, the doctrine that a sovereign could not be sued without its consent was universal in the States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified. See Chisholm, supra, at 434-435 (Iredell, J., dissenting) (""I believe there is no doubt that neither in the State now in question, nor in any other in the Union, any particular Legislative mode, authorizing a compulsory suit for the recovery of money against a State, was in being either when the Constitution was adopted, or at the time the judicial act was passed""); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 16 (1890) (""The suability of a State, without its consent, was a thing unknown to the law. This has been so often laid down and acknowledged by courts and jurists that it is hardly necessary to be formally asserted""). 12 The ratification debates, furthermore, underscored the importance of the States' sovereign immunity to the American people. Grave concerns were raised by the provisions of Article III which extended the federal judicial power to controversies between States and citizens of other States or foreign nations. As we have explained: 13 ""Unquestionably the doctrine of sovereign immunity was a matter of importance in the early days of independence. Many of the States were heavily indebted as a result of the Revolutionary War. They were vitally interested in the question whether the creation of a new federal sovereign, with courts of its own, would automatically subject them, like lower English lords, to suits in the courts of the `higher' sovereign."" Hall, supra, at 418 (footnote omitted). 14 The leading advocates of the Constitution assured the people in no uncertain terms that the Constitution would not strip the States of sovereign immunity. One assurance was contained in The Federalist No. 81, written by Alexander Hamilton: 15 ""It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union. Unless therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal... . [T]here is no color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign Will. To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts theyowe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident that it could not be done without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of the preexisting right of the State governments, a power which would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable."" Id., at 487-488 (emphasis in original). 16 At the Virginia ratifying convention, James Madison echoed this theme: 17 ""Its jurisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state is much objected to, and perhaps without reason. It is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court... . ""... It appears to me that this [clause] can have no operation but this--to give a citizen a right to be heard in the federal courts, and if a state should condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it."" 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 533 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates). When Madison's explanation was questioned, John Marshall provided immediate support: ""With respect to disputes between a state and the citizens of another state, its jurisdiction has been decried with unusual vehemence. I hope no Gentleman will think that a state will be called at the bar of the federal court. Is there no such case at present? Are there not many cases in which the Legislature of Virginia is a party, and yet the State is not sued? It is not rational to suppose, that the sovereign power shall be dragged before a court. The intent is, to enable states to recover claims of individuals residing in other states. I contend this construction is warranted by the words. But, say they, there will be partiality in it if a State cannot be defendant ... It is necessary to be so, and cannot be avoided. I see a difficulty in making a state defendant, which does not prevent its being plaintiff."" 3 id., at 555. 18 Although the state conventions which addressed the issue of sovereign immunity in their formal ratification documents sought to clarify the point by constitutional amendment, they made clear that they, like Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall, understood the Constitution as drafted to preserve the States' immunity from private suits. The Rhode Island Convention thus proclaimed that ""[i]t is declared by the Convention, that the judicial power of the United States, in cases in which a state may be a party, does not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to authorize any suit by any person against a state."" 1 id., at 336. The convention sought, in addition, an express amendment ""to remove all doubts or controversies respecting the same."" Ibid. In a similar fashion, the New York Convention ""declare[d] and ma[d]e known,"" 1 id., at 327, its understanding ""[t]hat the judicial power of the United States, in cases in which a state may be a party, does not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to authorize any suit by any person against a state,"" 1 id., at 329. The convention proceeded to ratify the Constitution ""[u]nder these impressions, and declaring that the rights aforesaid cannot be abridged or violated, and that the explanations aforesaid are consistent with the said Constitution, and in confidence that the amendments which shall have been proposed to the said Constitution will receive an early and mature consideration."" Ibid. 19 Despite the persuasive assurances of the Constitution's leading advocates and the expressed understanding of the only state conventions to address the issue in explicit terms, this Court held, just five years after the Constitution was adopted, that Article III authorized a private citizen of another State to sue the State of Georgia without its consent. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). Each of the four Justices who concurred in the judgment issued a separate opinion. The common theme of the opinions was that the case fell within the literal text of Article III, which by its terms granted jurisdiction over controversies ""between a State and Citizens of another State,"" and ""between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects."" U. S. Const., Art. III, § 2. The argument that this provision granted jurisdiction only over cases in which the State was a plaintiff was dismissed as inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of ""between,"" and with the provision extending jurisdiction to ""Controversies between two or more States,"" which by necessity contemplated jurisdiction over suits to which States were defendants. Two Justices also argued that sovereign immunity was inconsistent with the principle of popular sovereignty established by the Constitution, see 2 Dall., at 454-458 (Wilson, J.); id., at 470-472 (Jay, C. J.); although the others did not go so far, they contended that the text of Article III evidenced the States' surrender of sovereign immunity as to those provisions extending jurisdiction over suits to which States were parties, see id., at 452 (Blair, J.); id., at 468 (Cushing, J.). 20 Justice Iredell dissented, relying on American history, id., at 434-435, English history, id., at 437-446, and the principles of enumerated powers and separate sovereignty, id., at 435-436, 448, 449-450. See generally Hans, 134 U. S., at 12 (""The other justices were more swayed by a close observance of the letter of the Constitution, without regard to former experience and usage ... . Justice Iredell, on the contrary, contended that it was not the intention to create new and unheard of remedies, by subjecting sovereign States to actions at the suit of individuals, (which he conclusively showed was never done before,) but only ... to invest the federal courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine controversies and cases, between the parties designated, that were properly susceptible of litigation in courts""). 21 The Court's decision ""fell upon the country with a profound shock."" 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History 96 (rev. ed. 1926); accord, Hans, supra, at 11; Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934); Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 69. ""Newspapers representing a rainbow of opinion protested what they viewed as an unexpected blow to state sovereignty. Others spoke more concretely of prospective raids on state treasuries."" D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period 1789-1801, p. 196 (1997). 22 The States, in particular, responded with outrage to the decision. The Massachusetts Legislature, for example, denounced the decision as ""repugnant to the first principles of a federal government,"" and called upon the State's Senators and Representatives to take all necessary steps to ""remove any clause or article of the Constitution, which can be construed to imply or justify a decision, that, a State is compellable to answer in any suit by an individual or individuals in any Court of the United States."" 15 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 314 (H. Syrett & J. Cooke eds. 1969). Georgia's response was more intemperate: Its House of Representatives passed a bill providing that anyone attempting to enforce the Chisholm decision would be "" `guilty of felony and shall suffer death, without benefit of clergy, by being hanged.' "" Currie, supra, at 196. 23 An initial proposal to amend the Constitution was introduced in the House of Representatives the day after Chisholm was announced; the proposal adopted as the Eleventh Amendment was introduced in the Senate promptly following an intervening recess. Currie, supra, at 196. Congress turned to the latter proposal with great dispatch; little more than two months after its introduction it had been endorsed by both Houses and forwarded to the States. 4 Annals of Congress 25, 30, 477, 499 (1794); 1 Stat. 402. 24 Each House spent but a single day discussing the Amendment, and the vote in each House was close to unanimous. See 4 Annals, at 30-31, 476-478 (the Senate divided 23 to 2; the House 81 to 9). All attempts to weaken the Amendment were defeated. Congress in succession rejected proposals to limit the Amendment to suits in which ""the cause of action shall have arisen before the ratification of the amendment,"" or even to cases "" `[W]here such State shall have previously made provision in their own Courts, whereby such suit may be prosecuted to effect' ""; it refused as well to make an exception for "" `cases arising under treaties made under the authority of the United States.' "" 4 id., 30, 476. 25 It might be argued that the Chisholm decision was a correct interpretation of the constitutional design and that the Eleventh Amendment represented a deviation from the original understanding. This, however, seems unsupportable. First, despite the opinion of Justice Iredell, the majority failed to address either the practice or the understanding that prevailed in the States at the time the Constitution was adopted. Second, even a casual reading of the opinions suggests the majority suspected the decision would be unpopular and surprising. See, e.g., 2 Dall., at 454-455 (Wilson, J.) (condemning the prevailing conception of sovereignty); id., at 468 (Cushing, J.) (""If the Constitution is found inconvenient in practice in this or any other particular, it is well that a regular mode is pointed out for amendment""); id., at 478-479 (Jay, C. J.) (""[T]here is reason to hope that the people of [Georgia] will yet perceive that [sovereign immunity] would not have been consistent with [republican] equality""); cf. id., at 419-420 (attorney for Chisholm) (""I did not want the remonstrance of Georgia, to satisfy me, that the motion, which I have made is unpopular. Before that remonstrance was read, I had learnt from the acts of another State, whose will must be always dear to me, that she too condemned it""). Finally, two Members of the majority acknowledged that the United States might well remain immune from suit despite Article III's grant of jurisdiction over ""Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party,"" see id., at 469 (Cushing, J.); id., at 478 (Jay, C. J.), and, invoking the example of actions to collect debts incurred before the Constitution was adopted, one raised the possibility of ""exceptions,"" suggesting the rule of the case might not ""extend to all the demands, and to every kind of action,"" see id., at 479 (Jay, C. J.). These concessions undercut the crucial premise that either the Constitution's literal text or the principal of popular sovereignty necessarily overrode widespread practice and opinion. 26 The text and history of the Eleventh Amendment also suggest that Congress acted not to change but to restore the original constitutional design. Although earlier drafts of the Amendment had been phrased as express limits on the judicial power granted in Article III, see, e.g., 3 Annals of Congress 651-652 (1793) (""The Judicial Power of the United States shall not extend to any suits in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States ...""), the adopted text addressed the proper interpretation of that provision of the original Constitution, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 11 (""The Judicial Power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States ...""). By its terms, then, the Eleventh Amendment did not redefine the federal judicial power but instead overruled the Court: 27 ""This amendment, expressing the will of the ultimate sovereignty of the whole country, superior to all legislatures and all courts, actually reversed the decision of the Supreme Court. It did not in terms prohibit suits by individuals against the States, but declared that the Constitution should not be construed to import any power to authorize the bringing of such suits. ... The supreme court had construed the judicial power as extending to such a suit, and its decision was thus overruled."" Hans, 134 U. S., at 11. 28 The text reflects the historical context and the congressional objective in endorsing the Amendment for ratification. Congress chose not to enact language codifying the traditional understanding of sovereign immunity but rather to address the specific provisions of the Constitution that had raised concerns during the ratification debates and formed the basis of the Chisholm decision. Cf. 15 Papers of Alexander Hamilton, at 314 (quoted supra, at 10). Given the outraged reaction to Chisholm, as well as Congress' repeated refusal to otherwise qualify the text of the Amendment, it is doubtful that if Congress meant to write a new immunity into the Constitution it would have limited that immunity to the narrow text of the Eleventh Amendment: 29 ""Can we suppose that, when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted, it was understood to be left open for citizens of a State to sue their own state in federal courts, whilst the idea of suits by citizens of other states, or of foreign states, was indignantly repelled? Suppose that Congress, when proposing the Eleventh Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a State from being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, can we imagine that it would have been adopted by the States? The supposition that it would is almost an absurdity on its face."" Hans, supra, at 14-15. 30 The more natural inference is that the Constitution was understood, in light of its history and structure, to preserve the States' traditional immunity from private suits. As the Amendment clarified the only provisions of the Constitution that anyone had suggested might support a contrary understanding, there was no reason to draft with a broader brush. 31 Finally, the swiftness and near unanimity with which the Eleventh Amendment was adopted suggest ""either that the Court had not captured the original understanding, or that the country had changed its collective mind most rapidly."" D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Century 18, n. 101 (1985). The more reasonable interpretation, of course, is that regardless of the views of four Justices in Chisholm, the country as a whole--which had adopted the Constitution just five years earlier--had not understood the document to strip the States' of their immunity from private suits. Cf. Currie, The Constitution in Congress, at 196 (""It is plain that just about everybody in Congress agreed the Supreme Court had misread the Constitution""). 32 Although the dissent attempts to rewrite history to reflect a different original understanding, its evidence is unpersuasive. The handful of state statutory and constitutional provisions authorizing suits or petitions of right against States only confirms the prevalence of the traditional understanding that a State could not be sued in the absence of an express waiver, for if the understanding were otherwise, the provisions would have been unnecessary. The constitutional amendments proposed by the New York and Rhode Island Conventions undercut rather than support the dissent's view of history, see supra, at 8, and the amendments proposed by the Virginia and North Carolina Conventions do not cast light upon the original understanding of the States' immunity to suit. It is true that, in the course of all but eliminating federal-question and diversity jurisdiction, see 3 Elliot's Debates, at 660-661 (amendment proposed by the Virginia Convention limiting the federal-question jurisdiction to suits arising under treaties and the diversity jurisdiction to suits between parties claiming lands under grants from different states); 4 id., at 246 (identical amendment proposed by the North Carolina Convention), the amendments would have removed the language in the Constitution relied upon by the Chisholm Court. While the amendments do reflect dissatisfaction with the scope of federal jurisdiction as a general matter, there is no evidence that they were directed toward the question of sovereign immunity or that they reflect an understanding that the States would be subject to private suits without consent under Article III as drafted. 33 The dissent's remaining evidence cannot bear the weight the dissent seeks to place on it. The views voiced during the ratification debates by Edmund Randolph and James Wilson, when reiterated by the same individuals in their respective capacities as advocate and Justice in Chisholm, were decisively rejected by the Eleventh Amendment, and General Pinkney did not speak to the issue of sovereign immunity at all. Furthermore, Randolph appears to have recognized that his views were in tension with the traditional understanding of sovereign immunity, see 3 Elliot's Debates, at 573 (""I think, whatever the law of nations may say, that any doubt respecting the construction that a state may be plaintiff, and not defendant, is taken away by the words where a state shall be a party""), and Wilson and Pinkney expressed a radical nationalist vision of the constitutional design that not only deviated from the views that prevailed at the time but, despite the dissent's apparent embrace of the position, remains startling even today, see post, at 18 (quoting with approval Wilson's statement that "" `the government of each state ought to be subordinate to the government of the United States' ""). Nor do the controversial early suits prosecuted against Maryland and New York reflect a widespread understanding that the States had surrendered their immunity to suit. Maryland's decision to submit to process in Vanstophorst v. Maryland, 2 Dall. 401 (1791), aroused great controversy, see Marcus & Wexler, Suits Against States: Diversity of Opinion In The 1790s, 1993 J. Sup. Ct. History 73, 74-75, and did not go unnoticed by the Supreme Court, see Chisholm, 2 Dall., at 429-430 (Iredell, J., dissenting). In Oswald v. New York, the State refused to respond to the plaintiff's summons until after the decision in Chisholm had been announced; even then it at first asserted the defense that it was ""a free, sovereign and independent State,"" and could not be ""drawn or compelled"" to defend the suit. Marcus & Wexler, supra, at 76-77 (internal quotation marks omitted). And, though the Court's decision in Chisholm may have had ""champions `every bit as vigorous in defending their interpretation of the Constitution as were those partisans on the other side of the issue' "" post, at 37, the vote on the Eleventh Amendment makes clear that they were decidedly less numerous. See supra, at 11. 34 In short, the scanty and equivocal evidence offered by the dissent establishes no more than what is evident from the decision in Chisholm--that some members of the founding generation disagreed with Hamilton, Madison, Marshall, Iredell, and the only state conventions formally to address the matter. The events leading to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, however, make clear that the individuals who believed the Constitution stripped the States of their immunity from suit were at most a small minority. 35 Not only do the ratification debates and the events leading to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment reveal the original understanding of the States' constitutional immunity from suit, they also underscore the importance of sovereign immunity to the founding generation. Simply put, ""The Constitution never would have been ratified if the States and their courts were to be stripped of their sovereign authority except as expressly provided by the Constitution itself."" Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 239, n. 2 (1985); accord, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 660 (1974). C 36 The Court has been consistent in interpreting the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment as conclusive evidence ""that the decision in Chisholm was contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution,"" Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 69, and that the views expressed by Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall during the ratification debates, and by Justice Iredell in his dissenting opinion in Chisholm, reflect the original understanding of the Constitution. See, e.g., Hans, supra, at 12, 14-15, 18-19; Principality of Monaco, 292 U. S., at 325; Edelman, supra, at 660, n. 9; Seminole Tribe, supra, at 70, and nn. 12-13. In accordance with this understanding, we have recognized a ""presumption that no anomalous and unheard-of proceedings or suits were intended to be raised up by the Constitution--anomalous and unheard of when the constitution was adopted."" Hans, 134 U. S., at 18; accord, id., at 15. As a consequence, we have looked to ""history and experience, and the established order of things,"" id., at 14, rather than ""[a]dhering to the mere letter"" of the Eleventh Amendment, id., at 13, in determining the scope of the States' constitutional immunity from suit. 37 Following this approach, the Court has upheld States' assertions of sovereign immunity in various contexts falling outside the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment. In Hans v. Louisiana, the Court held that sovereign immunity barred a citizen from suing his own State under the federal-question head of jurisdiction. The Court was unmoved by the petitioner's argument that the Eleventh Amendment, by its terms, applied only to suits brought by citizens of other States: 38 ""It seems to us that these views of those great advocates and defenders of the Constitution were most sensible and just, and they apply equally to the present case as to that then under discussion. The letter is appealed to now, as it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an individual against a State. The reason against it is as strong in this case as it was in that. It is an attempt to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of."" 134 U. S., at 14-15. 39 Later decisions rejected similar requests to conform the principle of sovereign immunity to the strict language of the Eleventh Amendment in holding that nonconsenting States are immune from suits brought by federal corporations, Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900), foreign nations, Principality of Monaco, supra, or Indian tribes, Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775 (1991), and in concluding that sovereign immunity is a defense to suits in admiralty, though the text of the Eleventh Amendment addresses only suits ""in law or equity,"" Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490 (1921). 40 These holdings reflect a settled doctrinal understanding, consistent with the views of the leading advocates of the Constitution's ratification, that sovereign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself. See, e.g., Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 267-268 (1997) (acknowledging ""the broader concept of immunity, implicit in the Constitution, which we have regarded the Eleventh Amendment as evidencing and exemplifying""); Seminole Tribe, supra, at 55-56; Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98-99 (1984); Ex parte New York, supra, at 497. The Eleventh Amendment confirmed rather than established sovereign immunity as a constitutional principle; it follows that the scope of the States' immunity from suit is demarcated not by the text of the Amendment alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design. As we explained in Principality of Monaco: 41 ""Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of § 2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States. Behind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control. There is the essential postulate that the controversies, as contemplated, shall be found to be of a justiciable character. There is also the postulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where there has been `a surrender of this immunityin the plan of the convention.' "" 292 U. S., at 322-323 (quoting The Federalist No. 81, at 487) (footnote omitted). Or, as we have more recently reaffirmed: 42 ""Although the text of the Amendment would appear to restrict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, `we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition ... which it confirms.' Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, [supra, at 779]. That presupposition, first observed over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, [supra], has two parts: first, that each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system; and second, that ` ""[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent,"" ' id., at 13 (emphasis deleted), quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 ..."" Seminole Tribe, supra, at 54. 43 Accord, Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 146 (1993) (""The Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union, maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity""). II 44 In this case we must determine whether Congress has the power, under Article I, to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts. As the foregoing discussion makes clear, the fact that the Eleventh Amendment by its terms limits only ""[t]he Judicial power of the United States"" does not resolve the question. To rest on the words of the Amendment alone would be to engage in the type of ahistorical literalism we have rejected in interpreting the scope of the States' sovereign immunity since the discredited decision in Chisholm. Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 68; see also id., at 69 (quoting Principality of Monaco, supra, at 326, and Hans, 134 U. S., at 15) (""[W]e long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is `to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of ' ""). 45 While the constitutional principle of sovereign immunity does pose a bar to federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting States, see, e.g., Principality of Monaco, 292 U. S., at 322-323, this is not the only structural basis of sovereign immunity implicit in the constitutional design. Rather, ""[t]here is also the postulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where there has been `a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention.' "" Ibid. (quoting The Federalist No. 81, at 487); accord, Blatchford, supra, at 781; Seminole Tribe, supra, at 68. This separate and distinct structural principle is not directly related to the scope of the judicial power established by Article III, but inheres in the system of federalism established by the Constitution. In exercising its Article I powers Congress may subject the States to private suits in their own courts only if there is ""compelling evidence"" that the States were required to surrender this power to Congress pursuant to the constitutional design. Blatchford, 501 U. S., at 781. A Petitioners contend the text of the Constitution and our recent sovereign immunity decisions establish that the States were required to relinquish this portion of their sovereignty. We turn first to these sources. 46 * Article I, § 8 grants Congress broad power to enact legislation in several enumerated areas of national concern. The Supremacy Clause, furthermore, provides: 47 ""This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... , shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding."" U. S. Const., Art. VI. 48 It is contended that, by virtue of these provisions, where Congress enacts legislation subjecting the States to suit, the legislation by necessity overrides the sovereign immunity of the States. 49 As is evident from its text, however, the Supremacy Clause enshrines as ""the supreme Law of the Land"" only those federal Acts that accord with the constitutional design. See Printz, 521 U. S., at 924. Appeal to the Supremacy Clause alone merely raises the question whether a law is a valid exercise of the national power. See The Federalist No. 33, at 204 (A. Hamilton) (""But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land""); Printz, supra, at 924-925. 50 The Constitution, by delegating to Congress the power to establish the supreme law of the land when acting within its enumerated powers, does not foreclose a State from asserting immunity to claims arising under federal law merely because that law derives not from the State itself but from the national power. A contrary view could not be reconciled with Hans v. Louisiana, supra, which sustained Louisiana's immunity in a private suit arising under the Constitution itself; with Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 283 (1973), which recognized that the FLSA was binding upon Missouri but nevertheless upheld the State's immunity to a private suit to recover under that Act; or with numerous other decisions to the same effect. We reject any contention that substantive federal law by its own force necessarily overrides the sovereign immunity of the States. When a State asserts its immunity to suit, the question is not the primacy of federal law but the implementation of the law in a manner consistent with the constitutional sovereignty of the States. 51 Nor can we conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers. Although some of our decisions had endorsed this contention, see Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, 190-194 (1964); Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 13-23 (1989) (plurality opinion), they have since been overruled, see Seminole Tribe, supra, at 63-67, 72; College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., ante, p. ____ . As we have recognized in an analogous context: 52 ""When a `La[w] ... for carrying into Execution' the Commerce Clause violates the principle of state sovereignty reflected in the various constitutional provisions ... it is not a `La[w] ... proper for carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause,' and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, `merely [an] ac[t] of usurpation' which `deserve[s] to be treated as such.' "" Printz, supra, at 923-924 (quoting The Federalist No. 33, at 204 (A. Hamilton)) (ellipses and alterations in Printz). 53 The cases we have cited, of course, came at last to the conclusion that neither the Supremacy Clause nor the enumerated powers of Congress confer authority to abrogate the States' immunity from suit in federal court. The logic of the decisions, however, does not turn on the forum in which the suits were prosecuted but extends to state-court suits as well. 54 The dissenting opinion seeks to reopen these precedents, contending that state sovereign immunity must derive either from the common law (in which case the dissent contends it is defeasible by statute) or from natural law (in which case the dissent believes it cannot bar a federal claim). See post, at 41. As should be obvious to all, this is a false dichotomy. The text and the structure of the Constitution protect various rights and principles. Many of these, such as the right to trial by jury and the prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, derive from the common law. The common-law lineage of these rights does not mean they are defeasible by statute or remain mere common-law rights, however. They are, rather, constitutional rights, and form the fundamental law of the land. 55 Although the sovereign immunity of the States derives at least in part from the common-law tradition, the structure and history of the Constitution make clear that the immunity exists today by constitutional design. The dissent has provided no persuasive evidence that the founding generation regarded the States' sovereign immunity as defeasible by federal statute. While the dissent implies this view was held by Madison and Marshall, see post, at 20, nothing in the comments made by either individual at the ratification conventions states, or even implies, such an understanding. Although the dissent seizes upon Justice Iredell's statutory analysis in Chisholm in attempt to attribute this view to Justice Iredell, see post, at 30-31, citing Chisholm, 2 Dall., at 449 (Iredell, J., dissenting), Justice Iredell's views on the underlying constitutional question are clear enough from other portions of his dissenting opinion: 56 ""So much, however, has been said on the Constitution, that it may not be improper to intimate that my present opinion is strongly against any construction of it, which will admit, under any circumstances, a compulsive suit against a State for the recovery of money. I think every word in the Constitution may have its full effect without involving this consequence, and that nothing but express words, or an insurmountable implication (neither of which I consider, can be found in this case) would authorize the deduction of so high a power."" Id., at 449-450. 57 Despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, the fact that a right is not defeasible by statute means only that it is protected by the Constitution, not that it derives from natural law. Whether the dissent's attribution of our reasoning and conclusions to natural law results from analytical confusion or rhetorical device, it is simply inaccurate. We do not contend the founders could not have stripped the States of sovereign immunity and granted Congress power to subject them to private suit but only that they did not do so. By the same token, the contours of sovereign immunity are determined by the founders' understanding, not by the principles or limitations derived from natural law. 58 The dissent has offered no evidence that the founders believed sovereign immunity extended only to cases where the sovereign was the source of the right asserted. No such limitation existed on sovereign immunity in England, where sovereign immunity was predicated on a different theory altogether. See 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of English Law 518 (2d ed. 1909), quoted in Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 415, n. 6 ("" `[The King] can not be compelled to answer in his own court, but this is true of every petty lord of every petty manor' ""); accord, 3 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 465 (3d ed. 1927) (""[N]o feudal lord could be sued in his own court""). It is doubtful whether the King was regarded, in any meaningful sense, as the font of the traditions and customs which formed the substance of the common law, yet he could not be sued on a common-law claim in his own courts. And it strains credibility to imagine that the King could have been sued in his own court on, say, a French cause of action. 59 In light of the ratification debates and the history of the Eleventh Amendment, there is no reason to believe the founders intended the Constitution to preserve a more restricted immunity in the United States. On the contrary, Congress' refusal to modify the text of the Eleventh Amendment to create an exception to sovereign immunity for cases arising under treaties, see supra, at 11, suggests the States' sovereign immunity was understood to extend beyond state-law causes of action. And surely the dissent does not believe that sovereign immunity poses no bar to a state-law suit against the United States in federal court, or that the Federal Tort Claims Act effected a contraction, rather than an expansion, of the United States' amenability to suit. 2 60 There are isolated statements in some of our cases suggesting that the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable in state courts. See Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 204-205 (1991); Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 63 (1989); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 239-240, n. 2; Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 9, n. 7 (1980); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 418-421. This, of course, is a truism as to the literal terms of the Eleventh Amendment. As we have explained, however, the bare text of the Amendment is not an exhaustive description of the States' constitutional immunity from suit. The cases, furthermore, do not decide the question presented here--whether the States retain immunity from private suits in their own courts notwithstanding an attempted abrogation by the Congress. 61 Two of the cases discussing state-court immunity may be dismissed out of hand. The footnote digressions in Atascadero State Hospital and Thiboutot were irrelevant to either opinion's holding or rationale. The discussion in Will was also unnecessary to the decision; our holding that 42 U. S. C. § 1983 did not create a cause of action against the States rendered it unnecessary to determine the scope of the States' constitutional immunity from suit in their own courts. Our opinions in Hilton and Hall, however, require closer attention, for in those cases we sustained suits against States in state courts. 62 In Hilton we held that an injured employee of a state-owned railroad could sue his employer (an arm of the State) in state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U. S. C. §§ 51-60. Our decision was ""controlled and informed"" by stare decisis. 502 U. S., at 201. A generation earlier we had held that because the FELA made clear that all who operated railroads would be subject to suit by injured workers, States that chose to enter the railroad business after the statute's enactment impliedly waived their sovereign immunity from such suits. See Parden, supra. Some States had excluded railroad workers from the coverage of their workers' compensation statutes on the assumption that FELA provided adequate protection for those workers. Hilton, supra, at 202. Closing the courts to FELA suits against state employers would have dislodged settled expectations and required an extensive legislative response. Ibid. 63 There is language in Hilton which gives some support to the position of petitioners here but our decision did not squarely address, much less resolve, the question of Congress' power to abrogate States' immunity from suit in their own courts. The respondent in Hilton, the South Carolina Public Railways Commission, neither contested Congress' constitutional authority to subject it to suits for money damages nor raised sovereign immunity as an affirmative defense. See Brief for Respondent in No. 90-848, O. T. 1991, pp. 7, n. 14, 21. Nor was the State's litigation strategy surprising. Hilton was litigated and decided in the wake of Union Gas, and before this Court's decisions in New York, Printz, and Seminole Tribe. At that time it may have appeared to the State that Congress' power to abrogate its immunity from suit in any court was not limited by the Constitution at all, so long as Congress made its intent sufficiently clear. 64 Furthermore, our decision in Parden was based on concepts of waiver and consent. Although later decisions have undermined the basis of Parden's reasoning, see, e.g., Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 476-478 (1987) (recognizing that Parden erred in finding a clear congressional intent to subject the States to suit); College Savings Bank, ante, at ____ (overruling Parden's theory of constructive waiver), we have not questioned the general proposition that a State may waive its sovereign immunity and consent to suit, see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 65. 65 Hilton, then, must be read in light of the doctrinal basis of Parden, the issues presented and argued by the parties, and the substantial reliance interests drawn into question by the litigation. When so read, we believe the decision is best understood not as recognizing a congressional power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts, nor even as endorsing the constructive waiver theory of Parden, but as simply adhering, as a matter of stare decisis and presumed historical fact, to the narrow proposition that certain States had consented to be sued by injured workers covered by the FELA, at least in their own courts. 66 In Hall we considered whether California could subject Nevada to suit in California's courts and determined the Constitution did not bar it from doing so. We noted that ""[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity is an amalgam of two quite different concepts, one applicable to suits in the sovereign's own courts and the other to suits in the courts of another sovereign."" 440 U. S., at 414. We acknowledged that ""[t]he immunity of a truly independent sovereign from suit in its own courts has been enjoyed as a matter of absolute right for centuries. Only the sovereign's own consent could qualify the absolute character of that immunity,"" ibid, that ""the notion that immunity from suit is an attribute of sovereignty is reflected in our cases,"" id., at 415, and that ""[t]his explanation adequately supports the conclusion that no sovereign may be sued in its own courts without its consent,"" id., at 416. We sharply distinguished, however, a sovereign's immunity from suit in the courts of another sovereign: 67 ""[B]ut [this explanation] affords no support for a claim of immunity in another sovereign's courts. Such a claim necessarily implicates the power and authority of a second sovereign; its source must be found either in an agreement, express or implied, between the two sovereigns, or in the voluntary decision of the second to respect the dignity of the first as a matter of comity."" Ibid. 68 Since we determined the Constitution did not reflect an agreement between the States to respect the sovereign immunity of one another, California was free to determine whether it would respect Nevada's sovereignty as a matter of comity. 69 Our opinion in Hall did distinguish a State's immunity from suit in federal court from its immunity in the courts of other States; it did not, however, address or consider any differences between a State's sovereign immunity in federal court and in its own courts. Our reluctance to find an implied constitutional limit on the power of the States cannot be construed, furthermore, to support an analogous reluctance to find implied constitutional limits on the power of the Federal Government. The Constitution, after all, treats the powers of the States differently from the powers of the Federal Government. As we explained in Hall: 70 ""[I]n view of the Tenth Amendment's reminder that powers not delegated to the Federal Government nor prohibited to the States are reserved to the States or to the people, the existence of express limitations on state sovereignty may equally imply that caution should be exercised before concluding that unstated limitations on state power were intended by the Framers."" Id., at 425 (footnote omitted). 71 The Federal Government, by contrast, ""can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the constitution, and the powers actually granted must be such as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication."" Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816); see also City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 516 (1997); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 552 (1995). 72 Our decision in Hall thus does not support the argument urged by petitioners here. The decision addressed neither Congress' power to subject States to private suits nor the States' immunity from suit in their own courts. In fact, the distinction drawn between a sovereign's immunity in its own courts and its immunity in the courts of another sovereign, as well as the reasoning on which this distinction was based, are consistent with, and even support, the proposition urged by the respondent here--that the Constitution reserves to the States a constitutional immunity from private suits in their own courts which cannot be abrogated by Congress. 73 Petitioners seek support in two additional decisions. In Reich v. Collins, 513 U. S. 106 (1994), we held that, despite its immunity from suit in federal court, a State which holds out what plainly appears to be ""a clear and certain"" postdeprivation remedy for taxes collected in violation of federal law may not declare, after disputed taxes have been paid in reliance on this remedy, that the remedy does not in fact exist. Id., at 108. This case arose in the context of tax-refund litigation, where a State may deprive a taxpayer of all other means of challenging the validity of its tax laws by holding out what appears to be a ""clear and certain"" postdeprivation remedy. Ibid.; see also Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100 (1981). In this context, due process requires the State to provide the remedy it has promised. Cf. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 539 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The obligation arises from the Constitution itself; Reich does not speak to the powerof Congress to subject States to suits in their own courts. 74 In Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356 (1990), we held that a state court could not refuse to hear a §1983 suit against a school board on the basis of sovereign immunity. The school board was not an arm of the State, however, so it could not assert any constitutional defense of sovereign immunity to which the State would have been entitled. See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977). In Howlett, then, the only question was ""whether a state-law defense of `sovereign immunity' is available to a school board otherwise subject to suit in a Florida court even though such a defense would not be available if the action had been brought in a federal forum."" 496 U. S., at 358-359. The decision did not address the question of Congress' power to compel a state court to entertain an action against a nonconsenting State. B 75 Whether Congress has authority under Article I to abrogate a State's immunity from suit in its own courts is, then, a question of first impression. In determining whether there is ""compelling evidence"" that this derogation of the States' sovereignty is ""inherent in the constitutional compact,"" Blatchford, 501 U. S., at 781, we continue our discussion of history, practice, precedent, and the structure of the Constitution. 76 * We look first to evidence of the original understanding of the Constitution. Petitioners contend that because the ratification debates and the events surrounding the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment focused on the States' immunity from suit in federal courts, the historical record gives no instruction as to the founding generation's intent to preserve the States' immunity from suit in their own courts. 77 We believe, however, that the founders' silence is best explained by the simple fact that no one, not even the Constitution's most ardent opponents, suggested the document might strip the States of the immunity. In light of the overriding concern regarding the States' war-time debts, together with the well known creativity, foresight, and vivid imagination of the Constitution's opponents, the silence is most instructive. It suggests the sovereign's right to assert immunity from suit in its own courts was a principle so well established that no one conceived it would be altered by the new Constitution. 78 The arguments raised against the Constitution confirm this strong inference. In England, the rule was well established that ""no lord could be sued by a vassal in his own court, but each petty lord was subject to suit in the courts of a higher lord."" Hall, 440 U. S., at 414-415. It was argued that, by analogy, the States could be sued without consent in federal court. Id., at 418. The point of the argument was that federal jurisdiction under Article III would circumvent the States' immunity from suit in their own courts. The argument would have made little sense if the States were understood to have relinquished the immunity in all events. 79 The response the Constitution's advocates gave to the argument is also telling. Relying on custom and practice--and, in particular, on the States' immunity from suit in their own courts, see 3 Elliot's Debates, at 555 (Marshall)--they contended that no individual could sue a sovereign without its consent. It is true the point was directed toward the power of the Federal Judiciary, for that was the only question at issue. The logic of the argument, however, applies with even greater force in the context of a suit prosecuted against a sovereign in its own courts, for in this setting, more than any other, sovereign immunity was long established and unquestioned. See Hall, supra, at 414. 80 Similarly, while the Eleventh Amendment by its terms addresses only ""the Judicial power of the United States,"" nothing in Chisholm, the catalyst for the Amendment, suggested the States were not immune from suits in their own courts. The only Justice to address the issue, in fact, was explicit in distinguishing between sovereign immunity in federal court and in a State's own courts. See 2 Dall., at 452 (Blair, J.) (""When sovereigns are sued in their own Courts, such a method [a petition of right] may have been established as the most respectful form of demand; but we are not now in a State-Court; and if sovereignty be an exemption from suit in any other than the sovereign's own Courts, it follows that when a State, by adopting the Constitution, has agreed to be amenable to the judicial power of the United States, she has, in that respect, given up her right of sovereignty""). 81 The language of the Eleventh Amendment, furthermore, was directed toward the only provisions of the constitutional text believed to call the States' immunity from private suits into question. Although Article III expressly contemplated jurisdiction over suits between States and individuals, nothing in the Article or in any other part of the Constitution suggested the States could not assert immunity from private suit in their own courts or that Congress had the power to abrogate sovereign immunity there. 82 Finally, the Congress which endorsed the Eleventh Amendment rejected language limiting the Amendment's scope to cases where the States had made available a remedy in their own courts. See supra, at 11. Implicit in the proposal, it is evident, was the premise that the States retained their immunity and the concomitant authority to decide whether to allow private suits against the sovereign in their own courts. 83 In light of the language of the Constitution and the historical context, it is quite apparent why neither the ratification debates nor the language of the Eleventh Amendment addressed the States' immunity from suit in their own courts. The concerns voiced at the ratifying conventions, the furor raised by Chisholm, and the speed and unanimity with which the Amendment was adopted, moreover, underscore the jealous care with which the founding generation sought to preserve the sovereign immunity of the States. To read this history as permitting the inference that the Constitution stripped the States of immunity in their own courts and allowed Congress to subject them to suit there would turn on its head the concern of the founding generation--that Article III might be used to circumvent state-court immunity. In light of the historical record it is difficult to conceive that the Constitution would have been adopted if it had been understood to strip the States of immunity from suit in their own courts andcede to the Federal Government a power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in these fora. 2 84 Our historical analysis is supported by early congressional practice, which provides ""contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution's meaning."" Printz, 521 U. S., at 905 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although early Congresses enacted various statutes authorizing federal suits in state court, see id., at 906-907 (listing statutes); Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 389-390 (1947), we have discovered no instance in which they purported to authorize suits against nonconsenting States in these fora. The ""numerousness of these statutes [authorizing suit in state court], contrasted with the utter lack of statutes"" subjecting States to suit, ""suggests an assumed absence of such power."" 521 U. S., at 907-908. It thus appears early Congresses did not believe they had the power to authorize private suits against the States in their own courts. 85 Not only were statutes purporting to authorize private suits against nonconsenting States in state courts not enacted by early Congresses, statutes purporting to authorize such suits in any forum are all but absent from our historical experience. The first statute we confronted that even arguably purported to subject the States to private actions was the FELA. See Parden, 377 U. S., at 187 (""Here, for the first time in this Court, a State's claim of immunity against suit by an individual meets a suit brought upon a cause of action expressly created by Congress""). As we later recognized, however, even this statute did not clearly create a cause of action against the States. See Welch, 483 U. S., at 476-478. The provisions of the FLSA at issue here, which were enacted in the aftermath of Parden, are among the first statutory enactments purporting in express terms to subject nonconsenting States to private suits. Although similar statutes have multiplied in the last generation, ""they are of such recent vintage that they are no more probative than the [FLSA] of a constitutional tradition that lends meaning to the text. Their persuasive force is far outweighed by almost two centuries of apparent congressional avoidance of the practice."" 521 U. S., at 918. 86 Even the recent statutes, moreover, do not provide evidence of an understanding that Congress has a greater power to subject States to suit in their own courts than in federal courts. On the contrary, the statutes purport to create causes of actions against the States which are enforceable in federal, as well as state, court. To the extent recent practice thus departs from longstanding tradition, it reflects not so much an understanding that the States have surrendered their immunity from suit in their own courts as the erroneous view, perhaps inspired by Parden and Union Gas, that Congress may subject nonconsenting States to private suits in any forum. 3 87 The theory and reasoning of our earlier cases suggest the States do retain a constitutional immunity from suit in their own courts. We have often described the States' immunity in sweeping terms, without reference to whether the suit was prosecuted in state or federal court. See, e.g., Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257, 321-322 (1837) (""No sovereign state is liable to be sued without her consent""); Board of Liquidation v. McComb, 92 U. S. 531, 541 (1876) (""A State, without its consent, cannot be sued by an individual""); In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 506 (1887) (same); Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944) (""The inherent nature of sovereignty prevents actions against a state by its own citizens without its consent""). 88 We have said on many occasions, furthermore, that the States retain their immunity from private suits prosecuted in their own courts. See, e.g., Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858) (""It is an established principle of jurisprudence in all civilized nations that the sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts, or in any other, without its consent and permission""); Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, 101 U. S. 337, 339 (1880) (""The principle is elementary that a State cannot be sued in its own courts without its consent. This is a privilege of sovereignty""); Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co., 109 U. S. 446, 451 (1883) (""It may be accepted as a point of departure unquestioned, that neither a State nor the United States can be sued as defendant in any court in this country without their consent, except in the limited class of cases in which a State may be made a party in the Supreme Court of the United States by virtue of the original jurisdiction conferred on this court by the Constitution""); Louisianaex rel. New York Guaranty & Indemnity Co. v. Steele, 134 U. S. 230, 232 (1890) (finding a suit against a state official in state court to be ""clearly within the principle"" of the Eleventh Amendment decisions); Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 39 (1994) (""The Eleventh Amendment largely shields the States from suit in federal court without their consent, leaving the parties with claims against a State to present them, if the State permits, in the State's own tribunals""); Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 71, n. 14 (""[T]his Court is empowered to review a question of federal law arising from a state court decision where a State has consented to suit""); see also Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S., at 59 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (""The Eleventh Amendment has put state immunity from suit into the Constitution. Therefore, it is not in the power of individuals to bring any State into court--the State's or that of the United States--except with its consent""); accord, id., at 51, 53 (majority opinion); cf. Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 440 (1979); Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 71 (1985). 89 We have also relied on the States' immunity in their own courts as a premise in our Eleventh Amendment rulings. See Hans, 134 U. S., at 10 (""It is true the amendment does so read, and, if there were no other reason or ground for abating his suit, it might be maintainable; and then we should have this anomalous result [that a State may be sued by its own citizen though not by the citizen of another State, and that a State] may be thus sued in the federal courts, although not allowing itself to be sued in its own courts. If this is the necessary consequence of the language of the Constitution and the law, the result is no less startling and unexpected than [Chisholm]""); id., at 18 (""The state courts have no power to entertain suits by individuals against a State without its consent. Then how does the Circuit Court, having only concurrent jurisdiction, acquire any such power?""). 90 In particular, the exception to our sovereign immunity doctrine recognized in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), is based in part on the premise that sovereign immunity bars relief against States and their officers in both state and federal courts, and that certain suits for declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers must therefore be permitted if the Constitution is to remain the supreme law of the land. As we explained in General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211 (1908), a case decided the same day as Ex parte Young and extending the rule of that case to state-court suits: 91 ""It seems to be an obvious consequence that as a State can only perform its functions through its officers, a restraint upon them is a restraint upon its sovereignty from which it is exempt without its consent in the state tribunals, and exempt by the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in the national tribunals. The error is in the universality of the conclusion, as we have seen. Necessarily to give adequate protection to constitutional rights a distinction must be made between valid and invalid state laws, as determining the character of the suit against state officers. And the suit at bar illustrates the necessity. If a suit against state officers is precluded in the national courts by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution, and may be forbidden by a State to its courts, as it is contended in the case at bar that it may be, without power of review by this court, it must be evident that an easy way is open to prevent the enforcement of many provisions of the Constitution .... See Ex parte Young, ante, p. 123, where this subject is fully discussed and the cases reviewed."" 209 U. S., at 226-227. 92 Had we not understood the States to retain a constitutional immunity from suit in their own courts, the need for the Ex parte Young rule would have been less pressing, and the rule would not have formed so essential a part of our sovereign immunity doctrine. See Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S., at 270-271 (principal opinion). 93 As it is settled doctrine that neither substantive federal law nor attempted congressional abrogation under Article I bars a State from raising a constitutional defense of sovereign immunity in federal court, see Part II-A-1, supra, our decisions suggesting that the States retain an analogous constitutional immunity from private suits in their own courts support the conclusion that Congress lacks the Article I power to subject the States to private suits in those fora. 4 94 Our final consideration is whether a congressional power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts is consistent with the structure of the Constitution. We look both to the essential principles of federalism and to the special role of the state courts in the constitutional design. 95 Although the Constitution grants broad powers to Congress, our federalism requires that Congress treat the States in a manner consistent with their status as residuary sovereigns and joint participants in the governance of the Nation. See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 583 (concurring opinion); Printz, 521 U. S., at 935; New York, 505 U. S., at 188. The founding generation thought it ""neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had not been delegated to the United States, should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of private persons."" In re Ayers, 123 U. S., at 505. The principle of sovereign immunity preserved by constitutional design ""thus accords the States the respect owed them as members of the federation."" Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, 506 U. S., at 146; accord, Coeur d'Alene Tribe, supra, at 268 (recognizing ""the dignity and respect afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to protect""). 96 Petitioners contend that immunity from suit in federal court suffices to preserve the dignity of the States. Private suits against nonconsenting States, however, present ""the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties,"" In re Ayers, supra, at 505; accord, Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 58, regardless of the forum. Not only must a State defend or default but also it must face the prospect of being thrust, by federal fiat and against its will, into the disfavored status of a debtor, subject to the power of private citizens to levy on its treasury or perhaps even government buildings or property which the State administers on the public's behalf. 97 In some ways, of course, a congressional power to authorize private suits against nonconsenting States in their own courts would be even more offensive to state sovereignty than a power to authorize the suits in a federal forum. Although the immunity of one sovereign in the courts of another has often depended in part on comity or agreement, the immunity of a sovereign in its own courts has always been understood to be within the sole control of the sovereign itself. See generally Hall, 440 U. S., at 414-418. A power to press a State's own courts into federal service to coerce the other branches of the State, furthermore, is the power first to turn the State against itself and ultimately to commandeer the entire political machinery of the State against its will and at the behest of individuals. Cf. Coeur d'Alene Tribe, supra, at 276. Such plenary federal control of state governmental processes denigrates the separate sovereignty of the States. 98 It is unquestioned that the Federal Government retains its own immunity from suit not only in state tribunals but also in its own courts. In light of our constitutional system recognizing the essential sovereignty of the States, we are reluctant to conclude that the States are not entitled to a reciprocal privilege. 99 Underlying constitutional form are considerations of great substance. Private suits against nonconsenting States--especially suits for money damages--may threaten the financial integrity of the States. It is indisputable that, at the time of the founding, many of the States could have been forced into insolvency but for their immunity from private suits for money damages. Even today, an unlimited congressional power to authorize suits in state court to levy upon the treasuries of the States for compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and even punitive damages could create staggering burdens, giving Congress a power and a leverage over the States that is not contemplated by our constitutional design. The potential national power would pose a severe and notorious danger to the States and their resources. 100 A congressional power to strip the States of their immunity from private suits in their own courts would pose more subtle risks as well. ""The principle of immunity from litigation assures the states and the nation from unanticipated intervention in the processes of government."" Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S., at 53. When the States' immunity from private suits is disregarded, ""the course of their public policy and the administration of their public affairs"" may become ""subject to and controlled by the mandates of judicial tribunals without their consent, and in favor of individual interests."" In re Ayers, supra, at 505. While the States have relinquished their immunity from suit in some special contexts--at least as a practical matter--see Part III, infra, this surrender carries with it substantial costs to the autonomy, the decisionmaking ability, and the sovereign capacity of the States. 101 A general federal power to authorize private suits for money damages would place unwarranted strain on the States' ability to govern in accordance with the will of their citizens. Today, as at the time of the founding, the allocation of scarce resources among competing needs and interests lies at the heart of the political process. While the judgment creditor of the State may have a legitimate claim for compensation, other important needs and worthwhile ends compete for access to the public fisc. Since all cannot be satisfied in full, it is inevitable that difficult decisions involving the most sensitive and political of judgments must be made. If the principle of representative government is to be preserved to the States, the balance between competing interests must be reached after deliberation by the political process established by the citizens of the State, not by judicial decree mandated by the Federal Government and invoked by the private citizen. ""It needs no argument to show that the political power cannot be thus ousted of its jurisdiction and the judiciary set in its place."" Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711, 727-728 (1883). 102 By "" `split[ting] the atom of sovereignty,' "" the founders established "" `two orders of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it.' "" Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. ____, ___, n. 17 (1999), quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (concurring opinion). ""The Constitution thus contemplates that a State's government will represent and remain accountable to its own citizens."" Printz, 521 U. S., at 920. When the Federal Government asserts authority over a State's most fundamental political processes, it strikes at the heart of the political accountability so essential to our liberty and republican form of government. 103 The asserted authority would blur not only the distinct responsibilities of the State and National Governments but also the separate duties of the judicial and political branches of the state governments, displacing ""state decisions that `go to the heart of representative government.' "" Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461 (1991). A State is entitled to order the processes of its own governance, assigning to the political branches, rather than the courts, the responsibility for directing the payment of debts. See id., at 460 (""Through the structure of its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority, a State defines itself as a sovereign""). If Congress could displace a State's allocation of governmental power and responsibility, the judicial branch of the State, whose legitimacy derives from fidelity to the law, would be compelled to assume a role not only foreign to its experience but beyond its competence as defined by the very constitution from which its existence derives. 104 Congress cannot abrogate the States' sovereign immunity in federal court; were the rule to be different here, the National Government would wield greater power in the state courts than in its own judicial instrumentalities. Cf. Howlett, 496 U. S., at 365 (noting the anomaly that would arise if ""a State might be forced to entertain in its own courts suits from which it was immune in federal court""); Hilton, 502 U. S., at 206 (recognizing the ""federalism-related concerns that arise when the National Government uses the state courts as the exclusive forum to permit recovery under a congressional statute""). 105 The resulting anomaly cannot be explained by reference to the special role of the state courts in the constitutional design. Although Congress may not require the legislative or executive branches of the States to enact or administer federal regulatory programs, see Printz, supra, at 935; New York, 505 U. S., at 188, it may require state courts of ""adequate and appropriate"" jurisdiction, Testa, 330 U. S., at 394, ""to enforce federal prescriptions, insofar as those prescriptions relat[e] to matters appropriate for the judicial power,"" Printz, supra, at 907. It would be an unprecedented step, however, to infer from the fact that Congress may declare federal law binding and enforceable in state courts the further principle that Congress' authority to pursue federal objectives through the state judiciaries exceeds not only its power to press other branches of the State into its service but even its control over the federal courts themselves. The conclusion would imply that Congress may in some cases act only through instrumentalities of the States. Yet, as Chief Justice Marshall explained, ""No trace is to be found in the constitution of an intention to create a dependence of the government of the Union on those of the States, for the execution of the great powers assigned to it. Its means are adequate to its ends; and on those means alone was it expected to rely for the accomplishment of its ends."" McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 424 (1819); cf. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 821 (1824) (""It is not insinuated, that the judicial power, in cases depending on the character of the cause, cannot be exercised in the first instance, in the Courts of the Union, but must first be exercised in the tribunals of the State""). 106 The provisions of the Constitution upon which we have relied in finding the state courts peculiarly amenable to federal command, moreover, do not distinguish those courts from the Federal Judiciary. The Supremacy Clause does impose specific obligations on state judges. There can be no serious contention, however, that the Supremacy Clause imposes greater obligations on state-court judges than on the Judiciary of the United States itself. The text of Article III, §1, which extends federal judicial power to enumerated classes of suits but grants Congress discretion whether to establish inferior federal courts, does give strong support to the inference that state courts may be opened to suits falling within the federal judicial power. The Article in no way suggests, however, that state courts may be required to assume jurisdiction that could not be vested in the federal courts and forms no part of the judicial power of the United States. 107 We have recognized that Congress may require state courts to hear only ""matters appropriate for the judicial power,"" Printz, 521 U. S., at 907. Our sovereign immunity precedents establish that suits against nonconsenting States are not ""properly susceptible of litigation in courts,"" Hans, 134 U. S., at 12, and, as a result, that ""[t]he `entire judicial power granted by the Constitution' does not embrace authority to entertain such suits in the absence of the State's consent."" Principality of Monaco, 292 U. S., at 329 (quoting Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497); accord, 292 U. S., at 322-323 (private suits against nonconsenting sovereigns are not ""of a justiciable character""). We are aware of no constitutional precept that would admit of a congressional power to require state courts to entertain federal suits which are not within the judicial power of the United States and could not be heard in federal courts. As we explained in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938): 108 ""[T]he Constitution of the United States ... recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the States--independence in their legislative and independence in their judicial departments. Supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the States is in no case permissible except as to matters by the Constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States. Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority of the State and, to that extent, a denial of its independence."" Id., at 78-79. 109 In light of history, practice, precedent, and the structure of the Constitution, we hold that the States retain immunity from private suit in their own courts, an immunity beyond the congressional power to abrogate by Article I legislation. III 110 The constitutional privilege of a State to assert its sovereign immunity in its own courts does not confer upon the State a concomitant right to disregard the Constitution or valid federal law. The States and their officers are bound by obligations imposed by the Constitution and by federal statutes that comport with the constitutional design. We are unwilling to assume the States will refuse to honor the Constitution or obey the binding laws of the United States. The good faith of the States thus provides an important assurance that ""[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land."" U. S. Const., Art. VI. 111 Sovereign immunity, moreover, does not bar all judicial review of state compliance with the Constitution and valid federal law. Rather, certain limits are implicit in the constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity. 112 The first of these limits is that sovereign immunity bars suits only in the absence of consent. Many States, on their own initiative, have enacted statutes consenting to a wide variety of suits. The rigors of sovereign immunity are thus ""mitigated by a sense of justice which has continually expanded by consent the suability of the sovereign."" Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S., at 53. Nor, subject to constitutional limitations, does the Federal Government lack the authority or means to seek the States' voluntary consent to private suits. Cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987). 113 The States have consented, moreover, to some suits pursuant to the plan of the Convention or to subsequent constitutional amendments. In ratifying the Constitution, the States consented to suits brought by other States or by the Federal Government. Principality of Monaco, supra, at 328-329 (collecting cases). A suit which is commenced and prosecuted against a State in the name of the United States by those who are entrusted with the constitutional duty to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,"" U. S. Const., Art. II, § 3, differs in kind from the suit of an individual: While the Constitution contemplates suits among the members of the federal system as an alternative to extralegal measures, the fear of private suits against nonconsenting States was the central reason given by the founders who chose to preserve the States' sovereign immunity. Suits brought by the United States itself require the exercise of political responsibility for each suit prosecuted against a State, a control which isabsent from a broad delegation to private persons to sue nonconsenting States. 114 We have held also that in adopting the Fourteenth Amendment, the people required the States to surrender a portion of the sovereignty that had been preserved to them by the original Constitution, so that Congress may authorize private suits against nonconsenting States pursuant to its § 5 enforcement power. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976). By imposing explicit limits on the powers of the States and granting Congress the power to enforce them, the Amendment ""fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution."" Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 59. When Congress enacts appropriate legislation to enforce this Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), federal interests are paramount, and Congress may assert an authority over the States which would be otherwise unauthorized by the Constitution. Fitzpatrick, supra, at 456. 115 The second important limit to the principle of sovereign immunity is that it bars suits against States but not lesser entities. The immunity does not extend to suits prosecuted against a municipal corporation or other governmental entity which is not an arm of the State. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S., at 280; Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890). Nor does sovereign immunity bar all suits against state officers. Some suits against state officers are barred by the rule that sovereign immunity is not limited to suits which name the State as a party if the suits are, in fact, against the State. See, e.g., In re Ayers, 123 U. S., at 505-506; Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S., at 270 (""The real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of captions and pleading""). The rule, however, does not bar certain actions against state officers for injunctive or declaratory relief. Compare Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), and In re Ayers, supra, with Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, supra, Seminole Tribe, supra, and Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974). Even a suit for money damages may be prosecuted against a state officer in his individual capacity for unconstitutional or wrongful conduct fairly attributable to the officer himself, so long as the relief is sought not from the state treasury but from the officer personally. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 237-238 (1974); Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 462 (1945). 116 The principle of sovereign immunity as reflected in our jurisprudence strikes the proper balance between the supremacy of federal law and the separate sovereignty of the States. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S., at 105. Established rules provide ample means to correct ongoing violations of law and to vindicate the interests which animate the Supremacy Clause. See Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S., at 68. That we have, during the first 210 years of our constitutional history, found it unnecessary to decide the question presented here suggests a federal power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts is unnecessary to uphold the Constitution and valid federal statutes as the supreme law. IV 117 The sole remaining question is whether Maine has waived its immunity. The State of Maine ""regards the immunity from suit as `one of the highest attributes inherent in the nature of sovereignty,' "" Cushing v. Cohen, 420 A. 2d 919, 923 (Me. 1981) (quoting Drake v. Smith, 390 A. 2d 541, 543 (Me. 1978)), and adheres to the general rule that ""a specific authority conferred by an enactment of the legislature is requisite if the sovereign is to be taken as having shed the protective mantle of immunity,"" 420 A. 2d, at 923. Petitioners have not attempted to establish a waiver of immunity under this standard. Although petitioners contend the State has discriminated against federal rights by claiming sovereign immunity from this FLSA suit, there is no evidence that the State has manipulated its immunity in a systematic fashion to discriminate against federal causes of action. To the extent Maine has chosen to consent to certain classes of suits while maintaining its immunity from others, it has done no more than exercise a privilege of sovereignty concomitant to its constitutional immunity from suit. The State, we conclude, has not consented to suit. V 118 This case at one level concerns the formal structure of federalism, but in a Constitution as resilient as ours form mirrors substance. Congress has vast power but not all power. When Congress legislates in matters affecting the States, it may not treat these sovereign entities as mere prefectures or corporations. Congress must accord States the esteem due to them as joint participants in a federal system, one beginning with the premise of sovereignty in both the central Government and the separate States. Congress has ample means to ensure compliance with valid federal laws, but it must respect the sovereignty of the States. 119 In apparent attempt to disparage a conclusion with which it disagrees, the dissent attributes our reasoning to natural law. We seek to discover, however, only what the Framers and those who ratified the Constitution sought to accomplish when they created a federal system. We appeal to no higher authority than the Charter which they wrote and adopted. Theirs was the unique insight that freedom is enhanced by the creation of two governments, not one. We need not attach a label to our dissenting colleagues' insistence that the constitutional structure adopted by the founders must yield to the politics of the moment. Although the Constitution begins with the principle that sovereignty rests with the people, it does not follow that the National Government becomes the ultimate, preferred mechanism for expressing the people's will. The States exist as a refutation of that concept. In choosing to ordain and establish the Constitution, the people insisted upon a federal structure for the very purpose of rejecting the idea that the will of the people in all instances is expressed by the central power, the one most remote from their control. The Framers of the Constitution did not share our dissenting colleagues' belief that the Congress may circumvent the federal design by regulating the States directly when it pleases to do so, including by a proxy in which individual citizens are authorized to levy upon the state treasuries absent the States' consent to jurisdiction. 120 The case before us depends upon these principles. The State of Maine has not questioned Congress' power to prescribe substantive rules of federal law to which it must comply. Despite an initial good-faith disagreement about the requirements of the FLSA, it is conceded by all that the State has altered its conduct so that its compliance with federal law cannot now be questioned. The Solicitor General of the United States has appeared before this Court, however, and asserted that the federal interest in compensating the States' employees for alleged past violations of federal law is so compelling that the sovereign State of Maine must be stripped of its immunity and subjected to suit in its own courts by its own employees. Yet, despite specific statutory authorization, see 29 U. S. C. § 216(c), the United States apparently found the same interests insufficient to justify sending even a single attorney to Maine to prosecute this litigation. The difference between a suit by the United States on behalf ofthe employees and a suit by the employees implicates a rule that the National Government must itself deem the case of sufficient importance to take action against the State; and history, precedent, and the structure of the Constitution make clear that, under the plan of the Convention, the States have consented to suits of the first kind but not of the second. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine is Affirmed. 121 Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting. 122 In Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), a majority of this Court invoked the Eleventh Amendment to declare that the federal judicial power under Article III of the Constitution does not reach a private action against a State, even on a federal question. In the Court's conception, however, the Eleventh Amendment was understood as having been enhanced by a ""background principle"" of state sovereign immunity (understood as immunity to suit), see id., at 72, that operated beyond its limited codification in the Amendment, dealing solely with federal citizen-state diversity jurisdiction. To the Seminole Tribe dissenters, of whom I was one, the Court's enhancement of the Amendment was at odds with constitutional history and at war with the conception of divided sovereignty that is the essence of American federalism. 123 Today's issue arises naturally in the aftermath of the decision in Seminole Tribe. The Court holds that the Constitution bars an individual suit against a State to enforce a federal statutory right under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. § 201 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III), when brought in the State's courts over its objection. In thus complementing its earlier decision, the Court of course confronts the fact that the state forum renders the Eleventh Amendment beside the point, and it has responded by discerning a simpler and more straightforward theory of state sovereign immunity than it found in Seminole Tribe: a State's sovereign immunity from all individual suits is a ""fundamental aspect"" of state sovereignty ""confirm[ed]"" by the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 2, 3. As a consequence, Seminole Tribe's contorted reliance on the Eleventh Amendment and its background was presumably unnecessary; the Tenth would have done the work with an economy that the majority in Seminole Tribewould have welcomed. Indeed, if the Court's current reasoning is correct, the Eleventh Amendment itself was unnecessary. Whatever Article III may originally have said about the federal judicial power, the embarrassment to the State of Georgia occasioned by attempts in federal court to enforce the State's war debt could easily have been avoided if only the Court that decided Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), had understood a State's inherent, Tenth Amendment right to be free of any judicial power, whether the court be state or federal, and whether the cause of action arise under state or federal law. 124 The sequence of the Court's positions prompts a suspicion of error, and skepticism is confirmed by scrutiny of the Court's efforts to justify its holding. There is no evidence that the Tenth Amendment constitutionalized a concept of sovereign immunity as inherent in the notion of statehood, and no evidence that any concept of inherent sovereign immunity was understood historically to apply when the sovereign sued was not the font of the law. Nor does the Court fare any better with its subsidiary lines of reasoning, that the state-court action is barred by the scheme of American federalism, a result supposedly confirmed by a history largely devoid of precursors to the action considered here. The Court's federalism ignores the accepted authority of Congress to bind States under the FLSA and to provide for enforcement of federal rights in state court. The Court's history simply disparages the capacity of the Constitution to order relationships in a Republic that has changed since the founding. 125 On each point the Court has raised it is mistaken, and I respectfully dissent from its judgment. 126 * The Court rests its decision principally on the claim that immunity from suit was ""a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution,"" ante, at 2, an aspect which the Court understands to have survived the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and to have been ""confirm[ed]"" and given constitutional status, ante, at 3, by the adoption of the Tenth Amendment in 1791. If the Court truly means by ""sovereign immunity"" what that term meant at common law, see ante, at 25, its argument would be insupportable. While sovereign immunity entered many new state legal systems as a part of the common law selectively received from England, it was not understood to be indefeasible or to have been given any such status by the new National Constitution, which did not mention it. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 132-142, 160-162, and n. 55 (Souter, J., dissenting). Had the question been posed, state sovereign immunity could not have been thought to shield a State from suit under federal law on a subject committed to national jurisdiction by Article I of the Constitution. Congress exercising its conceded Article I power may unquestionably abrogate such immunity. I set out this position at length in my dissent in Seminole Tribe and will not repeat it here.1 127 The Court does not, however, offer today's holding as a mere corollary to its reasoning in Seminole Tribe, substituting the Tenth Amendment for the Eleventh as the occasion demands, and it is fair to read its references to a ""fundamental aspect"" of state sovereignty as referring not to a prerogative inherited from the Crown, but to a conception necessarily implied by statehood itself. The conception is thus not one of common law so much as of natural law, a universally applicable proposition discoverable by reason. This, I take it, is the sense in which the Court so emphatically relies on Alexander Hamilton's reference in The Federalist No. 81 to the States' sovereign immunity from suit as an ""inherent"" right, see ante, at 6, a characterization that does not require, but is at least open to, a natural law reading. 128 I understand the Court to rely on the Hamiltonian formulation with the object of suggesting that its conception of sovereign immunity as a ""fundamental aspect"" of sovereignty was a substantially popular, if not the dominant, view in the periods of Revolution and Confederation. There is, after all, nothing else in the Court's opinion that would suggest a basis for saying that the ratification of the Tenth Amendment gave this ""fundamental aspect"" its constitutional status and protection against any legislative tampering by Congress.2 The Court's principal rationale for today's result, then, turns on history: was the natural law conception of sovereign immunity as inherent in any notion of an independent State widely held in the United States in the period preceding the ratification of 1788 (or the adoption of the Tenth Amendment in 1791)? 129 The answer is certainly no. There is almost no evidence that the generation of the Framers thought sovereign immunity was fundamental in the sense of being unalterable. Whether one looks at the period before the framing, to the ratification controversies, or to the early republican era, the evidence is the same. Some Framers thought sovereign immunity was an obsolete royal prerogative inapplicable in a republic; some thought sovereign immunity was a common-law power defeasible, like other common-law rights, by statute; and perhaps a few thought, in keeping with a natural law view distinct from the common-law conception, that immunity was inherent in a sovereign because the body that made a law could not logically be bound by it. Natural law thinking on the part of a doubtful few will not, however, support the Court's position. 130 * The American Colonies did not enjoy sovereign immunity, that being a privilege understood in English law to be reserved for the Crown alone; ""antecedent to the Declaration of Independence, none of the colonies were, or pretended to be, sovereign states,"" 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution § 207, p. 149 (5th ed. 1891). Several colonial charters, including those of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Georgia, expressly specified that the corporate body established thereunder could sue and be sued. See 5 Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 36 (W. Swindler ed. 1975) (Massachusetts); 2 id., at 131 (Connecticut); 8 id., at 363 (Rhode Island); 2 id., at 434 (Georgia). Other charters were given to individuals, who were necessarily subject to suit. See Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889, 1897 (1983). If a colonial lawyer had looked into Blackstone for the theory of sovereign immunity, as indeed many did,he would have found nothing clearly suggesting that the Colonies as such enjoyed any immunity from suit. ""[T]he law ascribes to the king the attribute of sovereignty, or pre-eminence,"" said Blackstone, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *241 (hereinafter Blackstone), and for him, the sources for this notion were Bracton3 and Acts of Parliament that declared the Crown imperial. Id., at *241-*242. It was simply the King against whom ""no suit or action can be brought ... even in civil matters, because no court can have jurisdiction over him."" Id., at *242.4 If a person should have ""a just demand upon the king, he must petition him in his court of chancery, where his chancellor will administer right as a matter of grace though not upon compulsion."" Id., at *243. 131 It is worth pausing here to note that after Blackstone had explained sovereign immunity at common law, he went on to say that the common-law tradition was compatible with sovereign immunity as discussed by writers on ""natural law"": 132 ""And this is entirely consonant to what is laid down by the writers on natural law. `A subject,' says Puffendorf, `so long as he continues a subject, hath no way to oblige his prince to give him his due, when he refuses it; though no wise prince will ever refuse to stand to a lawful contract. And, if the prince gives the subject leave to enter an action against him, upon such contract, in his own courts, the action itself proceeds rather upon natural equity, than upon the municipal laws.' For the end of such action is not to compel the prince to observe the contract, but to persuade him."" Ibid. (footnote omitted).5 133 Next Blackstone quoted Locke's explanation for immunity, according to which the risks of overreaching by "" `a heady prince' "" are "" `well recompensed by the peace of the public and security of the government, in the person of the chief magistrate, being thus set out of the reach of danger.' "" Ibid. (quoting J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government § 205 (1690 J. Gough ed. 1947)). By quoting Pufendorf and Locke, Blackstone revealed to his readers a legal-philosophical tradition that derived sovereign immunity not from the immemorial practice of England but from general theoretical principles. But although Blackstone thus juxtaposed the common-law and natural law6 conceptions of sovereign immunity, he did not confuse them. It was as well he did not, for although the two conceptions were arguably ""consonant"" in England, where according to Blackstone, the Crown was sovereign,7 their distinct foundations could make a difference in America, where the location of sovereignty was an issue that independence would raise with some exigence. B 134 Starting in the mid-1760's, ideas about sovereignty in colonial America began to shift as Americans argued that, lacking a voice in Parliament, they had not in any express way consented to being taxed. See B. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 204-219 (1968); G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787, pp. 347-348 (1969). The story of the subsequent development of conceptions of sovereignty is complex and uneven; here, it is enough to say that by the time independence was declared in 1776, the locus of sovereignty was still an open question, except that almost by definition, advocates of independence denied that sovereignty with respect to the American Colonies remained with the King in Parliament. 135 As the concept of sovereignty was unsettled, so was that of sovereign immunity. Some States appear to have understood themselves to be without immunity from suit in their own courts upon independence.8 Connecticut and Rhode Island adopted their pre-existing charters as constitutions, without altering the provisions specifying their suability. See Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1898, and nn. 42-43. Other new States understood themselves to be inheritors of the Crown's common-law sovereign immunity and so enacted statutes authorizing legal remedies against the State parallel to those available in England.9 There, although the Crown was immune from suit, the contemporary practice allowed private litigants to seek legal remedies against the Crown through the petition of right or the monstrans de droit in the Chancery or Exchequer. See 3 Blackstone *256-257. A Virginia statute provided: 136 ""Where the auditors according to their discretion and judgment shall disallow or abate any article of demand against the commonwealth, and any person shall think himself aggrieved thereby, he shall be at liberty to petition the high court of chancery or the general court, according to the nature of his case, for redress, and such court shall proceed to do right thereon; and a like petition shall be allowed in all other cases to any other person who is entitled to demand against the commonwealth any right in law or equity."" 9 W. Hening, Statutes at Large: Being a Collection of the Laws of Virginia 536, 540 (1821); see Pfander, Sovereign Immunity and the Right to Petition: Toward a First Amendment Right to Pursue Judicial Claims Against the Government, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 899, 939-940, and n. 142 (1997). 137 This ""petition"" was clearly reminiscent of the English petition of right, as was the language ""shall proceed to do right thereon,"" which paralleled the formula of royal approval, ""soit droit fait al partie,"" technically required before a petition of right could be adjudicated. See 3 Blackstone *256; Pfander, supra, at 940, and nn. 143-144. A New York statute similarly authorized petition to the court of chancery by anyone who thought himself aggrieved by the state auditor general's resolution of his account with the State. See An Act Directing a Mode for the Recovery of Debts due to, and the Settlement of Accounts with this State, March 30, 1781, in The First Laws of the State of New York 192 (1782 ed., reprinted 1984); see also Pfander, supra, at 941, and n. 145. 138 Pennsylvania not only adopted a law conferring the authority to settle accounts upon the Comptroller General, see Act of Apr. 13, 1782, ch. 959, 2 Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 19 (1810), but in 1785 provided for appeal from such adjudications to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, where a jury trial could be had, see id., at 26-27; Pfander, supra, at 941, n. 147. Although in at least one recorded case before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court the Commonwealth, citing Blackstone, pleaded common-law sovereign immunity, see Respublica v. Sparhawk, 1 Dall. 357, 363 (Pa. 1788), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did not reach this argument, concluding on other grounds that it lacked jurisdiction.10 Two years after this decision, under the influence of James Wilson, see C. Jacobs, The Eleventh Amendment and Sovereign Immunity 25, and 169, n. 53 (1972), Pennsylvania adopted a new constitution, which provided that ""[s]uits may be brought against the commonwealth in such manner, in such courts, and in such cases as the legislature may by law direct."" Pa. Const., Art. IX, § 11 (1790), reprinted in 8 Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions, at 293; see also Pfander, supra, at 928, n. 101.11 139 Around the time of the Constitutional Convention, then, there existed among the States some diversity of practice with respect to sovereign immunity; but despite a tendency among the state constitutions to announce and declare certain inalienable and natural rights of men and even of the collective people of a State, see, e.g., Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. III (1776), 8 Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions, supra, at 278 (""That the people of this State have the sole, exclusive and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same""), no State declared that sovereign immunity was one of those rights. To the extent that States were thought to possess immunity, it was perceived as a prerogative of the sovereign under common law. And where sovereign immunity was recognized as barring suit, provisions for recovery from the State were in order, just as they had been at common law in England. C 140 At the Constitutional Convention, the notion of sovereign immunity, whether as natural law or as common law, was not an immediate subject of debate, and the sovereignty of a State in its own courts seems not to have been mentioned. This comes as no surprise, for although the Constitution required state courts to apply federal law, the Framers did not consider the possibility that federal law might bind States, say, in their relations with their employees.12 In the subsequent ratification debates, however, the issue of jurisdiction over a State did emerge in the question whether States might be sued on their debts in federal court, and on this point, too, a variety of views emerged and the diversity of sovereign immunity conceptions displayed itself. 141 The only arguable support for the Court's absolutist view that I have found among the leading participants in the debate surrounding ratification was the one already mentioned, that of Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist No. 81, where he described the sovereign immunity of the States in language suggesting principles associated with natural law: 142 ""It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union. Unless therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated [that States might be sued on their debts in federal court] must be merely ideal. ... The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will."" The Federalist No. 81, pp. 548-549 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). 143 Hamilton chose his words carefully, and he acknowledged the possibility that at the Convention the States might have surrendered sovereign immunity in some circumstances, but the thrust of his argument was that sovereign immunity was ""inherent in the nature of sovereignty.""13 An echo of Pufendorf may be heard in his reference to ""the conscience of the sovereign"";14 and the universality of the phenomenon of sovereign immunity, which Hamilton claimed (""the general sense and the general practice of mankind""), is a peculiar feature of the natural law conception. The apparent novelty and uniqueness of Hamilton's employment of natural law terminology to explain the sovereign immunity of the States is worth remarking, because it stands in contrast to formulations indicating no particular position on the natural-law-versus-common-law origin, to the more widespread view that sovereign immunity derived from common law, and to the more radical stance that the sovereignty of the people made sovereign immunity out of place in the United States. Hamilton's view is also worth noticing because, in marked contrast to its prominence in the Court's opinion today, as well as in Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 54, and in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 13 (1890), cf. Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), it found no favor in the early Supreme Court, see infra, at 21-22. 144 In the Virginia ratifying convention, Madison was among those who debated sovereign immunity in terms of the result it produced, not its theoretical underpinnings. He maintained that ""[i]t is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court,"" 3 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 533 (2d ed. 1836) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates), and thought that the phrase ""in which a State shall be a Party"" in Article III, § 2, must be interpreted in light of that general principle, so that ""[t]he only operation it can have, is that, if a state should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must be brought before the federal court."" Ibid.15 John Marshall argued along the same lines against the possibility of federal jurisdiction over private suits against States, and he invoked the immunity of a State in its own courts in support of his argument: 145 ""I hope that no gentleman will think that a state will be called at the bar of the federal court. Is there no such case at present? Are there not many cases in which the legislature of Virginia is a party, and yet the state is not sued? It is not rational to suppose that the sovereign power should be dragged before a court."" Id., at 555. 146 There was no unanimity among the Virginians either on state- or federal-court immunity, however, for Edmund Randolph anticipated the position he would later espouse as plaintiff's counsel in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). He contented himself with agnosticism on the significance of what Hamilton had called ""the general practice of mankind,"" and argued that notwithstanding any natural law view of the nonsuability of States, the Constitution permitted suit against a State in federal court: ""I think, whatever the law of nations may say, that any doubt respecting the construction that a state may be plaintiff, and not defendant, is taken away by the words where a state shall be a party."" 3 Elliot's Debates 573. Randolph clearly believed that the Constitution both could and in fact by its language did trump any inherent immunity enjoyed by the States; his view on sovereign immunity in state court seems to have been that the issue was uncertain (""whatever the law of nations may say""). 147 At the farthest extreme from Hamilton, James Wilson made several comments in the Pennsylvania Convention that suggested his hostility to any idea of state sovereign immunity. First, he responded to the argument that ""the sovereignty of the states is destroyed"" if they are sued by the United States, ""because a suiter in a court must acknowledge the jurisdiction of that court, and it is not the custom of sovereigns to suffer their names to be made use of in this manner."" 2 id., at 490. For Wilson, ""[t]he answer [was] plain and easy: the government of each state ought to be subordinate to the government of the United States."" Ibid.16 Wilson was also pointed in commenting on federal jurisdiction over cases between a State and citizens of another State: ""When this power is attended to, it will be found to be a necessary one. Impartiality is the leading feature in this Constitution; it pervades the whole. When a citizen has a controversy with another state, there ought to be a tribunal where both parties may stand on a just and equal footing."" Id., at 491. Finally, Wilson laid out his view that sovereignty was in fact not located in the States at all: ""Upon what principle is it contended that the sovereign power resides in the state governments? The honorable gentleman has said truly, that there can be no subordinate sovereignty. Now, if there cannot, my position is, that the sovereignty resides in the people; they have not parted with it; they have only dispensed such portions of the power as were conceived necessary for the public welfare."" Id., at 443.17 While this statement did not specifically address sovereign immunity, it expressed the major premise of what would later become Justice Wilson's position in Chisholm: that because the people, and not the States, are sovereign, sovereign immunity has no applicability to the States. 148 From a canvass of this spectrum of opinion expressed at the ratifying conventions, one thing is certain. No one was espousing an indefeasible, natural law view of sovereign immunity. The controversy over the enforceability of state debts subject to state law produced emphatic support for sovereign immunity from eminences as great as Madison and Marshall, but neither of them indicated adherence to any immunity conception outside the common law. D 149 At the close of the ratification debates, the issue of the sovereign immunity of the States under Article III had not been definitively resolved, and in some instances the indeterminacy led the ratification conventions to respond in ways that point to the range of thinking about the doctrine. Several state ratifying conventions proposed amendments and issued declarations that would have exempted States from subjection to suit in federal court.18 The New York Convention's statement of ratification included a series of declarations framed as proposed amendments, among which was one stating ""That the judicial power of the United States, in cases in which a state may be a party, does not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to authorize any suit by any person against a state."" 1 Elliot's Debates 329.19 Whether that amendment was meant to alter or to clarify Article III as ratified is uncertain, but regardless of its precise intent, New York's response to the draft proposed by the Convention of 1787 shows that there was no consensus at all on the question of state suability (let alone on the underlying theory of immunity doctrine). There was, rather, an unclear state of affairs which it seemed advisable to stabilize. 150 The Rhode Island Convention, when it finally ratified on June 16, 1790, called upon its representatives to urge the passage of a list of amendments. This list incorporated language, some of it identical to that proposed by New York, in the following form: 151 ""It is declared by the Convention, that the judicial power of the United States, in cases in which a state may be a party, does not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to authorize any suit by any person against a state; but, to remove all doubts or controversies respecting the same, that it be especially expressed, as a part of the Constitution of the United States, that Congress shall not, directly or indirectly, either by themselves or through the judiciary, interfere with any one of the states ... in liquidating and discharging the public securities of any one state."" 1 id., at 336. 152 Even more clearly than New York's proposal, this amendment appears to have been intended to clarify Article III as reflecting some theory of sovereign immunity, though without indicating which one. 153 Unlike the Rhode Island proposal, which hinted at a clarification of Article III, the Virginia and North Carolina ratifying conventions proposed amendments that by their terms would have fundamentally altered the content of Article III. The Virginia Convention's proposal for a new Article III omitted entirely the language conferring federal jurisdiction over a controversy between a State and citizens of another State, see 3 id., at 660-661, and the North Carolina Convention proposed an identical amendment, see 4 id., at 246-247. These proposals for omission suggest that the conventions of Virginia and North Carolina thought they had subjected themselves to citizen suits under Article III as enacted, and that they wished not to have done so.20 There is, thus, no suggestion in their resolutions that Article III as drafted was fundamentally at odds with an indefeasible natural law sovereignty, or with a conception that went to the essence of what it meant to be a State. At all events, the state ratifying conventions' felt need for clarification on the question of state suability demonstrates that uncertainty surrounded the matter even at the moment of ratification. This uncertainty set the stage for the divergent views expressed in Chisholm. E 154 If the natural law conception of sovereign immunity as an inherent characteristic of sovereignty enjoyed by the States had been broadly accepted at the time of the founding, one would expect to find it reflected somewhere in the five opinions delivered by the Court in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). Yet that view did not appear in any of them. And since a bare two years before Chisholm, the Bill of Rights had been added to the original Constitution, if the Tenth Amendment had been understood to give federal constitutional status to state sovereign immunity so as to endue it with the equivalent of the natural law conception, one would be certain to find such a development mentioned somewhere in the Chisholm writings. In fact, however, not one of the opinions espoused the natural law view, and not one of them so much as mentioned the Tenth Amendment. Not even Justice Iredell, who alone among the Justices thought that a State could not be sued in federal court, echoed Hamilton or hinted at a constitutionally immutable immunity doctrine. 155 Chisholm presented the questions whether a State might be made a defendant in a suit brought by a citizen of another State, and if so, whether an action of assumpsit would lie against it. See id., at 420 (questions presented).21 In representing Chisholm, Edmund Randolph, the Framer22 and then Attorney General, not only argued for the necessity of a federal forum to vindicate private rights against the States, see id., at 422, but rejected any traditional conception of sovereignty. He said that the sovereignty of the States, which he acknowledged, id., at 423, was no barrier to jurisdiction, because ""the present Constitution produced a new order of things. It derives its origin immediately from the people ... . The States are in fact assemblages of these individuals who are liable to process,"" ibid. 156 Justice Wilson took up the argument for the sovereignty of the people more vociferously. Building on a conception of sovereignty he had already expressed at the Pennsylvania ratifying convention, see supra, at 18-19, he began by noting what he took to be the pregnant silence of the Constitution regarding sovereignty: 157 ""To the Constitution of the United States the term SOVEREIGN, is totally unknown. There is but one place where it could have been used with propriety. But, even in that place it would not, perhaps, have comported with the delicacy of those, who ordained and established the Constitution. They might have announced themselves `SOVEREIGN' people of the United States: But serenely conscious of the fact, they avoided the ostentatious declaration."" 2 Dall. at 454. 158 As if to contrast his own directness23 with the Framers' delicacy, the Framer-turned-Justice explained in no uncertain terms that Georgia was not sovereign with respect to federal jurisdiction (even in a diversity case): 159 ""As a Judge of this Court, I know, and can decide upon the knowledge, that the citizens of Georgia, when they acted upon the large scale of the Union, as a part of the `People of the United States,' did not surrender the Supreme or Sovereign Power to that State; but, as to the purposes of the Union, retained it to themselves. As to the purposes of the Union, therefore, Georgia is NOT a sovereign State."" Id., at 457. 160 This was necessarily to reject any natural law conception of sovereign immunity as inherently attached to an American State, but this was not all. Justice Wilson went on to identify the origin of sovereign immunity in the feudal system that had, he said, been brought to England and to the common law by the Norman Conquest. After quoting Blackstone's formulation of the doctrine as it had developed in England, he discussed it in the most disapproving terms imaginable: 161 ""This last position [that the King is sovereign and no court can have jurisdiction over him] is only a branch of a much more extensive principle, on which a plan of systematic despotism has been lately formed in England, and prosecuted with unwearied assiduity and care. Of this plan the author of the Commentaries was, if not the introducer, at least the great supporter. He has been followed in it by writers later and less known; and his doctrines have, both on the other and this side of the Atlantic, been implicitly and generally received by those, who neither examined their principles nor their consequences[.] The principle is, that all human law must be prescribed by a superior. This principle I mean not now to examine. Suffice it, at present to say, that another principle, very different in its nature and operations, forms, in my judgment, the basis of sound and genuine jurisprudence; laws derived from the pure source of equality and justice must be founded on the CONSENT of those, whose obedience theyrequire. The sovereign, when traced to his source, must be found in the man."" Id., at 458. 162 With this rousing conclusion of revolutionary ideology and rhetoric, Justice Wilson left no doubt that he thought the doctrine of sovereign immunity entirely anomalous in the American Republic. Although he did not speak specifically of a State's immunity in its own courts, his view necessarily requires that such immunity would not have been justifiable as a tenet of absolutist natural law. 163 Chief Justice Jay took a less vehement tone in his opinion, but he, too, denied the applicability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity to the States. He explained the doctrine as an incident of European feudalism, id., at 471, and said that by contrast, 164 ""[n]o such ideas obtain here; at the Revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people; and they are truly the sovereigns of the country, but they are sovereigns without subjects (unless the African slaves among us may be so called) and have none to govern but themselves; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citizens, and as joint tenants in the sovereignty."" Id., at 471-472. 165 From the difference between the sovereignty of princes and that of the people, Chief Justice Jay argued, it followed that a State might be sued. When a State sued another State, as all agreed it could do in federal court, all the people of one State sued all the people of the other. ""But why it should be more incompatible, that all the people of a State should be sued by one citizen, than by one hundred thousand, I cannot perceive, the process in both cases being alike; and the consequences of a judgment alike."" Id., at 473. Finally, Chief Justice Jay pointed out, Article III authorized suits between a State and citizens of another State. Although the Chief Justice reserved judgment on whether the United States might be sued by a citizen, given that the courts must rely on the Executive to implement their decisions, he made it clear that this reservation was practical, and not theoretical: ""I wish the State of society was so far improved, and the science of Government advanced to such a degree of perfection, as that the whole nation could in the peaceable course of law, be compelled to do justice, and be sued by individual citizens."" Id., at 478. Although Chief Justice Jay did not speak specifically to the question of state sovereign immunity in state court, his theory shows that he considered not the States, but the people collectively, to be sovereign; and there is thus no reason to think he would have denied that the people of the Nation could override any state claim to sovereign immunity in a matter committed to the Nation. 166 Justice Cushing's opinion relied on the express language of Article III to hold that Georgia might be sued in federal court. He dealt shortly with the objection that States' sovereignty would be thereby restricted so that States would be reduced to corporations: ""As to corporations, all States whatever are corporations or bodies politic. The only question is, what are their powers?"" Id., at 468. Observing that the Constitution limits the powers of the States in numerous ways, he concluded that ""no argument of force can be taken from the sovereignty of States. Where it has been abridged, it was thought necessary for the greater indispensable good of the whole."" Ibid. From the opinion, it is not possible to tell with certainty what Justice Cushing thought about state sovereign immunity in state court, although his introductory remark is suggestive. The case, he wrote, ""turns not upon the law or practice of England, although perhaps it may be in some measure elucidated thereby, nor upon the law of any other country whatever; but upon the Constitution established by the people of the United States."" Id., at 466. It is clear that he had no sympathy for a view of sovereign immunity inherent in statehood and untouchable by national legislative authority. 167 Justice Blair, like Justice Cushing, relied on Article III, and his brief opinion shows that he acknowledged state sovereign immunity, but common-law immunity in state court. First, Justice Blair asked hypothetically whether a verdict against the plaintiff would be preclusive if the plaintiff ""should renew his suit against the State, in any mode in which she may permit herself to be sued in her own Courts."" Id., at 452. Second, he commented that there was no need to require the plaintiff to proceed by way of petition: 168 ""When sovereigns are sued in their own Courts, such a method may have been established as the most respectful form of demand; but we are not now in a State-Court; and if sovereignty be an exemption from suit in any other than the sovereign's own Courts, it follows that when a State, by adopting the Constitution, has agreed to be amenable to the judicial power of the United States, she has, in that respect, given up her right of sovereignty."" Ibid. 169 It is worth noting that for Justice Blair, the petition brought in state court was properly called a suit. This reflects the contemporary practice of his native Virginia, where, as we have seen, supra, at 10-11, suits as of right against the State were authorized by statute. Justice Blair called sovereignty ""an exemption from suit in any other than the sovereign's own Courts"" because he assumed that, in its own courts, a sovereign will naturally permit itself to be sued as of right. 170 Justice Iredell was the only Member of the Court to hold that the suit could not lie; but if his discussion was far-reaching, his reasoning was cautious. Its core was that the Court could not assume a waiver of the State's common-law sovereign immunity where Congress had not expressly passed such a waiver. See 2 Dall., at 449 (dissenting opinion). Although Justice Iredell added, in what he clearly identified as dictum, that he was ""strongly against"" any construction of the Constitution ""which will admit, under any circumstances, a compulsive suit against a State for the recovery of money,"" ibid.,24 he made it equally clear that he understood sovereign immunityas a common-law doctrine passed to the States withindependence: 171 ""No other part of the common law of England, it appears to me, can have any reference to this subject, but that part of it which prescribes remedies against the crown. Every State in the Union in every instance where its sovereignty has not been delegated to the United States, I consider to be as compleatly sovereign, as the United States are in respect to the powers surrendered. The United States are sovereign as to all the powers of Government actually surrendered: Each State in the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved. It must necessarily be so, because the United States have no claim to any authority but such as the States have surrendered to them: Of course the part not surrenderred must remain as it did before."" Id., at 435. 172 This did not mean, of course, that the States had not delegated to Congress the power to subject them to suit, but merely that such a delegation would have been necessary on Justice Iredell's view. 173 In sum, then, in Chisholm two Justices (Jay and Wilson), both of whom had been present at the Constitutional Convention, took a position suggesting that States should not enjoy sovereign immunity (however conceived) even in their own courts; one (Cushing) was essentially silent on the issue of sovereign immunity in state court; one (Blair) took a cautious position affirming the pragmatic view that sovereign immunity was a continuing common law doctrine and that States would permit suit against themselves as of right; and one (Iredell) expressly thought that state sovereign immunity at common-law rightly belonged to the sovereign States. Not a single Justice suggested that sovereign immunity was an inherent and indefeasible right of statehood, and neither counsel for Georgia before the Circuit Court, see supra, at 24, n. 21, nor Justice Iredell seems even to have conceived the possibility that the new Tenth Amendment produced the equivalent of such a doctrine. This dearth of support makes it very implausible for today's Court to argue that a substantial (let alone a dominant) body of thought at the time of the framing understood sovereign immunity to be an inherent right of statehood, adopted or confirmed by the Tenth Amendment.25 174 The Court's discomfort is evident in its obvious recognition that its natural law or Tenth Amendment conception of state sovereign immunity is insupportable if Chisholm stands. Hence the Court's attempt to discount the Chisholm opinions, an enterprise in which I believe it fails. 175 The Court, citing Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), says that the Eleventh Amendment ""overruled"" Chisholm, ante, at 12, but the animadversion is beside the point. The significance of Chisholm is its indication that in 1788 and 1791 it was not generally assumed (indeed, hardly assumed at all) that a State's sovereign immunity from suit in its own courts was an inherent, and not merely a comon-law, advantage. On the contrary, the testimony of five eminent legal minds of the day confirmed that virtually everyone who understood immunity to be legitimate saw it as a common-law prerogative (from which it follows that it was subject to abrogation by Congress as to a matter within Congress's Article I authority). 176 The Court does no better with its trio of arguments to undercut Chisholm's legitimacy: that the Chisholm majority ""failed to address either the practice or the understanding that prevailed in the States at the time the Constitution was adopted,"" ante, at 11; that ""the majority suspected the decision would be unpopular and surprising,"" ibid.; and that ""two Members of the majority acknowledged that the United States might well remain immune from suit despite"" Article III, ante, at 12. These three claims do not, of course, go to the question whether state sovereign immunity was understood to be ""fundamental"" or ""inherent,"" but in any case, none of them is convincing. 177 With respect to the first, Justice Blair in fact did expressly refer to the practice of state sovereign immunity in state court, and acknowledged the petition of right as an appropriate and normal practice. This aside, the Court would have a legitimate point if it could show that the Chisholm majority took insufficient account of a body of practice that somehow indicated a widely held absolutist conception of state sovereign immunity untouchable and untouched by the Constitution. But of course it cannot.26 178 As for the second point, it is a remarkable doctrine that would hold anticipation of unpopularity the benchmark of constitutional error. In any event, the evidence proffered by the Court is merely this: that Justice Wilson thought the prerevolutionary conception of sovereignty misguided, 2 Dall., at 454-455; that Justice Cushing stated axiomatically that the Constitution could always be amended, id., at 468; that Chief Justice Jay noted that the losing defendant might still come to understand that sovereign immunity is inconsistent with republicanism, id., at 478-479; and that Attorney General Randolph admitted that the position he espoused was unpopular not only in Georgia, but also in another State, probably Virginia.27 These items boil down to the proposition that the Justices knew (as who could not, with such a case before him) that at the ratifying conventions the significance of sovereign immunity had been, as it still was, a matter of dispute. This reality does not detract from, but confirms, the view that the Framers showed no intent to recognize sovereign immunity as an immutably inherent power of the States. 179 As to the third objection, that two Justices noted that the United States might possess sovereign immunity notwithstanding Article III, I explained, supra, at 28, that Chief Justice Jay thought this possibility was purely practical, not at all legal, and without any implication for state immunity vis-a-vis federal claims. Justice Cushing was so little troubled by the possibility he raised that he wrote, ""If this be a necessary consequence, it must be so,"" Chisholm, supra, at 469, and simply suggested a textual reading that might have led to a different consequence. 180 Nor can the Court make good on its claim that the enactment of the Eleventh Amendment retrospectively reestablished the view that had already been established at the time of the framing (though eluding the perception of all but one Member of the Supreme Court), and hence ""acted ... to restore the original constitutional design,"" ante, at 12.28 There was nothing ""established"" about the position espoused by Georgia in the effort to repudiate its debts, and the Court's implausible suggestion to the contrary merely echoes the brio of its remark in Seminole Tribe that Chisholm was ""contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution."" 517 U. S., at 69 (citing Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934)). The fact that Chisholm was no conceptual aberration is apparent from the ratification debates and the several state requests to rewrite Article III. There was no received view either of the role this sovereign immunity would play in the circumstances of the case or of a conceptual foundation for immunity doctrine at odds with Chisholm's reading of Article III. As an author on whom the Court relies, see ante, at 14, has it, ""there was no unanimity among the Framers that immunity would exist,"" D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Century 19 (1985).29 181 It should not be surprising, then, to realize that although much post-Chisholm discussion was disapproving (as the States saw their escape from debt cut off), the decision had champions ""every bit as vigorous in defending their interpretation of the Constitution as were those partisans on the other side of the issue."" Marcus & Wexler, Suits Against States: Diversity of Opinion In The 1790s, 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist. 73, 83; see, e.g., 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court, supra, at 251-252, 252-253, 262-264, 268-269 (newspaper articles supporting holding in Chisholm); 5 Documentary History, supra n. 17, at 616 (statement of a Committee of Delaware Senate in support of holding in Chisholm). The federal citizen-state diversity jurisdiction was settled by the Eleventh Amendment; Article III was not ""restored."" F 182 It is clear enough that the Court has no historical predicate to argue for a fundamental or inherent theory of sovereign immunity as limiting authority elsewhere conferred by the Constitution or as imported into the Constitution by the Tenth Amendment. But what if the facts were otherwise and a natural law conception of state sovereign immunity in a State's own courts were implicit in the Constitution? On good authority, it would avail the State nothing, and the Court would be no less mistaken than it is already in sustaining the State's claim today. 183 The opinion of this Court that comes closer to embodying the present majority's inherent, natural law theory of sovereign immunity than any other I can find was written by Justice Holmes in Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349 (1907).30 I do not, of course, suggest that Justice Holmes was a natural law jurist, see ""Natural Law,"" in O. Holmes, Collected Legal Papers 312 (1920) (""The jurists who believe in natural law seem to me to be in that na ;ve state of mind that accepts what has been familiar and accepted ... as something that must be accepted""). But in Kawananakoa he not only gave a cogent restatement of the natural law view of sovereign immunity, but one that includes a feature (omitted from Hamilton's formulation) explaining why even the most absolutist version of sovereign immunity doctrine actually refutes the Court's position today: the Court fails to realize that under the natural law theory, sovereign immunity may be invoked only by the sovereign that is the source of the right upon which suit is brought. Justice Holmes said so expressly: ""A sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends."" Kawananakoa, supra, at 353. 184 His cited authorities stand in the line that today's Court purports to follow: Hobbes, Bodin, Sir John Eliot, and Baldus de Ubaldis. Hobbes, in the cited work, said this: 185 ""The sovereign of a Commonwealth, be it an assembly or one man, is not subject to the civil laws. For having power to make and repeal laws, he may, when he pleaseth, free himself from that subjection by repealing those laws that trouble him, and making of new; and consequently he was free before. For he is free that can be free when he will: nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himself, because he that can bind can release; and therefore he that is bound to himself only is not bound."" Leviathan ch. 26, § 2, p. 130. 186 Jean Bodin produced a similar explanation nearly three-quarters of a century before Hobbes, see J. Bodin, Les six livres de la republique, Bk. 1, ch. 8 (1577); Six Books of the Commonwealth 28 (M. Tooley transl. 1967) (""[T]he sovereign ... cannot in any way be subject to the commands of another, for it is he who makes law""). Eliot cited Baldus for the crux of the theory: majesty is ""a fulness of power subject to noe necessitie, limitted within no rules of publicke Law,"" 1 J. Eliot, De Jure Maiestatis: or Political Treatise of Government 15 (A. Grosart ed. 1882), and Baldus himself made the point in observing that no one is bound by his own statute as of necessity, see Commentary of Baldus on the statute Digna vox in Justinian's Code 1.14.4, Lectura super Codice folio 51b (Chapter De Legibus et constitutionibus) (Venice ed. 1496) (""nemo suo statuto ligatur necessitative""). 187 The ""jurists who believe in natural law"" might have reproved Justice Holmes for his general skepticism about the intrinsic value of their views, but they would not have faulted him for seeing the consequence of their position: if the sovereign is not the source of the law to be applied, sovereign immunity has no applicability. Justice Holmes indeed explained that in the case of multiple sovereignties, the subordinate sovereign will not be immune where the source of the right of action is the sovereign that is dominant. See Kawananakoa, 205 U. S., at 353, 354 (District of Columbia not immune to private suit, because private rights there are ""created and controlled by Congress and not by a legislature of the District""). Since the law in this case proceeds from the national source, whose laws authorized by Article I are binding in state courts, sovereign immunity cannot be a defense. After Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), Justice Holmes's logically impeccable theory yields the clear conclusion that even in a system of ""fundamental"" state sovereign immunity, a State would be subject to suit eo nomine in its own courts on a federal claim. 188 There is no escape from the trap of Holmes's logic save recourse to the argument that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not the rationally necessary or inherent immunity of the civilians, but the historically contingent, and to a degree illogical, immunity of the common law. But if the Court admits that the source of sovereign immunity is the common law, it must also admit that the common-law doctrine could be changed by Congress acting under the Commerce Clause. It is not for me to say which way the Court should turn; but in either case it is clear that Alden's suit should go forward. II 189 The Court's rationale for today's holding based on a conception of sovereign immunity as somehow fundamental to sovereignty or inherent in statehood fails for the lack of any substantial support for such a conception in the thinking of the founding era. The Court cannot be counted out yet, however, for it has a second line of argument looking not to a clause-based reception of the natural law conception or even to its recognition as a ""background principle,"" see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 72, but to a structural basis in the Constitution's creation of a federal system. Immunity, the Court says, ""inheres in the system of federalism established by the Constitution,"" ante, at 21, its ""contours [being] determined by the founders' understanding, not by the principles or limitations derived from natural law,"" ante, at 25. Again, ""[w]e look both to the essential principles of federalism and to the special role of the state courts in the constitutional design."" Ante, at 39. That is, the Court believes that the federal constitutional structure itself necessitates recognition of some degree of state autonomy broad enough to include sovereign immunity from suit in a State's own courts, regardless of the federal source of the claim asserted against the State. If one were to read the Court's federal structure rationale in isolation from the preceding portions of the opinion, it would appear that the Court's position on state sovereign immunity might have been rested entirely on federalism alone. If it had been, however, I would still be in dissent, for the Court's argument that state court sovereign immunity on federal questions is inherent in the very concept of federal structure is demonstrably mistaken. 190 * The National Constitution formally and finally repudiated the received political wisdom that a system of multiple sovereignties constituted the ""great solecism of an imperium in imperio,"" cf. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution, at 223.31 Once ""the atom of sovereignty"" had been split, U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring), the general scheme of delegated sovereignty as between the two component governments of the federal system was clear, and was succinctly stated by Chief Justice Marshall: ""In America, the powers of sovereignty are divided between the government of the Union, and those of the States. They are each sovereign, with respect to the objects committed to it, and neither sovereign with respect to the objects committed to the other."" McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 410 (1819).32 191 Hence the flaw in the Court's appeal to federalism. The State of Maine is not sovereign with respect to the national objective of the FLSA.33 It is not the authority that promulgated the FLSA, on which the right of action in this case depends. That authority is the United States acting through the Congress, whose legislative power under Article I of the Constitution to extend FLSA coverage to state employees has already been decided, see Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), and is not contested here. 192 Nor can it be argued that because the State of Maine creates its own court system, it has authority to decide what sorts of claims may be entertained there, and thus in effect to control the right of action in this case. Maine has created state courts of general jurisdiction; once it has done so, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 2, which requires state courts to enforce federal law and state-court judges to be bound by it, requires the Maine courts to entertain this federal cause of action. Maine has advanced no "" `valid excuse,' "" Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 369 (1990) (quoting Douglas v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279 U. S. 377, 387-88 (1929)), for its courts' refusal to hear federal-law claims in which Maine is a defendant, and sovereign immunity cannot be that excuse, simply because the State is not sovereign with respect to the subject of the claim against it. The Court's insistence that the federal structure bars Congress from making States susceptible to suit in their own courts is, then, plain mistake.34 B 193 It is symptomatic of the weakness of the structural notion proffered by the Court that it seeks to buttress the argument by relying on ""the dignity and respect afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to protect,"" ante, at 39 (quoting Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 268 (1997)), and by invoking the many demands on a State's fisc, ante, at 41-42. Apparently beguiled by Gilded Era language describing private suits against States as "" `neither becoming nor convenient,' "" ante, at 39 (quoting In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 505 (1887)), the Court calls ""immunity from private suits central to sovereign dignity,"" ante, at 4, and assumes that this ""dignity"" is a quality easily translated from the person of the King to the participatory abstraction of a republican State, see, e.g., ante, at 40 (""[C]ongressional power to authorize private suits against nonconsenting States in their own courts would be ... offensive to state sovereignty""). The thoroughly anomalous character of this appeal to dignity is obvious from a reading of Blackstone's description of royal dignity, which he sets out as a premise of his discussion ofsovereignty: 194 ""First, then, of the royal dignity. Under every monarchical establishment, it is necessary to distinguish the prince from his subjects... . The law therefore ascribes to the king ... certain attributes of a great and transcendent nature; by which the people are led to consider him in the light of a superior being, and to pay him that awful respect, which may enable him with greater ease to carry on the business of government. This is what I understand by the royal dignity, the several branches of which we will now proceed to examine."" 1 Blackstone *241. 195 It would be hard to imagine anything more inimical to the republican conception, which rests on the understanding of its citizens precisely that the government is not above them, but of them, its actions being governed by law just like their own. Whatever justification there may be for an American government's immunity from private suit, it is not dignity.35 See United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 208 (1882). 196 It is equally puzzling to hear the Court say that ""federal power to authorize private suits for money damages would place unwarranted strain on the States' ability to govern in accordance with the will of their citizens."" Ante, at 41-42. So long as the citizens' will, expressed through state legislation, does not violate valid federal law, the strain will not be felt; and to the extent that state action does violate federal law, the will of the citizens of the United States already trumps that of the citizens of the State: the strain then is not only expected, but necessarily intended. 197 Least of all does the Court persuade by observing that ""other important needs"" than that of the ""judgment creditor"" compete for public money, ante, at 42. The ""judgment creditor"" in question is not a dunning bill- collector, but a citizen whose federal rights have been violated, and a constitutional structure that stints on enforcing federal rights out of an abundance of delicacy toward the States has substituted politesse in place of respect for the rule of law.36 III 198 If neither theory nor structure can supply the basis for the Court's conceptions of sovereign immunity and federalism, then perhaps history might. The Court apparently believes that because state courts have not historically entertained Commerce Clause-based federal-law claims against the States, such an innovation carries a presumption of unconstitutionality. See ante, at 34 (arguing that absence of statutes authorizing suits against States in state court suggests an assumed absence of such power). At the outset, it has to be noted that this approach assumes a more cohesive record than history affords. In Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197 (1991) (Kennedy, J.), a case the Court labors mightily to distinguish, see ante, at 26-27,37 we held that a state-owned railroad could be sued in state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. §§ 51-60, notwithstanding the lack of an express congressional statement, because "" `the Eleventh Amendment does not apply in state courts.' "" Hilton, supra, at 205 (quoting Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 63-64 (1989)).38 But even if the record were less unkempt, the problem with arguing from historical practice in this case is that past practice, even if unbroken, provides no basis for demanding preservation when the conditions on which the practice depended have changed in a constitutionally relevant way. 199 It was at one time, though perhaps not from the framing, believed that ""Congress' authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause"" was limited by ""certain underlying elements of political sovereignty ... deemed essential to the States' `separate and independent existence.' "" See Garcia, 469 U. S., at 547-548 (quoting Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869)). On this belief, the preordained balance between state and federal sovereignty was understood to trump the terms of Article I and preclude Congress from subjecting States to federal law on certain subjects. (From time to time, wage and hour regulation has been counted among those subjects, see infra, at 52.) As a consequence it was rare, if not unknown, for state courts to confront the situation in which federal law enacted under the Commerce Clause provided the authority for a private right of action against a State in state court. The question of state immunity from a Commerce Clause-based federal-law suit in state court thus tended not to arise for the simple reason that acts of Congress authorizing such suits did not exist. 200 Today, however, in light of Garcia, supra (overruling National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976)), the law is settled that federal legislation enacted under the Commerce Clause may bind the States without having to satisfy a test of undue incursion into state sovereignty. ""[T]he fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme imposes on the Commerce Clause to protect the `States as States' is one of process rather than one of result."" Garcia, supra, at 554. Because the commerce power is no longer thought to be circumscribed, the dearth of prior private federal claims entertained against the States in state courts does not tell us anything, and reflects nothing but an earlier and less expansive application of the commerce power. 201 Least of all is it to the point for the Court to suggest that because the Framers would be surprised to find States subjected to a federal-law suit in their own courts under the commerce power, the suit must be prohibited by the Constitution. See ante, at 31-34 (arguing on the basis of the ""historical record"" that the Constitution would not have been adopted if it had been understood to allow suit against States in state court under federal law). The Framers' intentions and expectations count so far as they point to the meaning of the Constitution's text or the fair implications of its structure, but they do not hover over the instrument to veto any application of its principles to a world that the Framers could not have anticipated. 202 If the Framers would be surprised to see States subjected to suit in their own courts under the commerce power, they would be astonished by the reach of Congress under the Commerce Clause generally. The proliferation of Government, State and Federal, would amaze the Framers, and the administrative state with its reams of regulations would leave them rubbing their eyes. But the Framers' surprise at, say, the FLSA, or the Federal Communications Commission, or the Federal Reserve Board is no threat to the constitutionality of any one of them, for a very fundamental reason: 203 ""[W]hen we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago."" Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 433 (1920) (Holmes, J.). 204 "" `We must never forget,' said Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch, [4 Wheat., at] 407, `that it is a Constitution we are expounding.' Since then this Court has repeatedly sustained the exercise of power by Congress, under various clauses of that instrument, over objects of which the Fathers could not have dreamed."" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 472 (1928) (Brandeis, J. dissenting). IV 205 * If today's decision occasions regret at its anomalous versions of history and federal theory, it is the more regrettable in being the second time the Court has suddenly changed the course of prior decision in order to limit the exercise of authority over a subject now concededly within the Article I jurisdiction of the Congress. The FLSA, which requires employers to pay a minimum wage, was first enacted in 1938, with an exemption for States acting as employers. See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 185-186 (1968). In 1966, it was amended to remove the state employer exemption so far as it concerned workers in hospitals, institutions, and schools. See id., at 186-187, and n. 6. In Wirtz, the Court upheld the amendment over the dissent's argument that extending the FLSA to these state employees was ""such a serious invasion of state sovereignty protected by the Tenth Amendment that it is ... not consistent with our constitutional federalism."" Id., at 201 (opinion of Douglas, J.). 206 In 1974, Congress again amended the FLSA, this time ""extend[ing] the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions to almost all public employees employed by the States and by their various political subdivisions."" National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 836. This time the Court went the other way: in National League of Cities, the Court held the extension of the Act to these employees an unconstitutional infringement of state sovereignty, id., at 852; for good measure, the Court overturned Wirtz, dismissing its reasoning as no longer authoritative, see 426 U. S., at 854-855. 207 But National League of Cities was not the last word. In Garcia, decided some nine years later, the Court addressed the question whether a municipally owned mass-transit system was exempt from the FLSA. 469 U. S., at 534, 536. In holding that it was not, the Court overruled National League of Cities, see 469 U. S., at 557, this time taking the position that Congress was not barred by the Constitution from binding the States as employers under the Commerce Clause, id., at 554. As already mentioned, the Court held that whatever protection the Constitution afforded to the States' sovereignty lay in the constitutional structure, not in some substantive guarantee. Ibid.39 Garcia remains good law, its reasoning has not been repudiated, and it has not been challenged here. 208 The FLSA has not, however, fared as well in practice as it has in theory. The Court in Seminole Tribe created a significant impediment to the statute's practical application by rendering its damages provisions unenforceable against the States by private suit in federal court. Today's decision blocking private actions in state courts makes the barrier to individual enforcement a total one. B 209 The Court might respond to the charge that in practice it has vitiated Garcia by insisting, as counsel for Maine argued, Brief for Respondent 11-12, that the United States may bring suit in federal court against a State for damages under the FLSA, on the authority of United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 644-645 (1892). See also Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 71, n. 14. It is true, of course, that the FLSA does authorize the Secretary of Labor to file suit seeking damages, see 29 U. S. C. § 216(c), but unless Congress plans a significant expansion of the National Goverment's litigating forces to provide a lawyer whenever private litigation is barred by today's decision and Seminole Tribe, the allusion to enforcement of private rights by the National Government is probably not much more than whimsy. Facing reality, Congress specifically found, as long ago as 1974, ""that the enforcement capability of the Secretary of Labor is not alone sufficient to provide redress in all or even a substantial portion of the situations where compliance is not forthcoming voluntarily."" S. Rep. No. 93-690, p. 27 (1974). One hopes that such voluntary compliance will prove more popular than it has in Maine, for there is no reason today to suspect that enforcement by the Secretary of Labor alone would likely prove adequate to assure compliance with this federal law in the multifarious circumstances of some 4.7 million employees of the 50 States of the Union.40 210 The point is not that the difficulties of enforcement should drive the Court's decision, but simply that where Congress has created a private right to damages, it is implausible to claim that enforcement by a public authority without any incentive beyond its general enforcement power will ever afford the private right a traditionally adequate remedy. No one would think the remedy adequate if private tort claims against a State could only be brought by the National Government: the tradition of private enforcement, as old as the common law itself, is the benchmark. But wage claims have a lineage of private enforcement just as ancient, and a claim under the FLSA is a claim for wages due on work performed. Denying private enforcement of an FLSA claim is thus on par with closing the courthouse door to state tort victims unaccompanied by a lawyer from Washington. 211 So there is much irony in the Court's profession that it grounds its opinion on a deeply rooted historical tradition of sovereign immunity, when the Court abandons a principle nearly as inveterate, and much closer to the hearts of the Framers: that where there is a right, there must be a remedy. Lord Chief Justice Holt could state this as an unquestioned proposition already in 1702, as he did in Ashby v. White, 6 Mod. 45, 53-54, 87 Eng. Rep. 808, 815 (K.B.): 212 ""If an Act of Parliament be made for the benefit of any person, and he is hindered by another of that benefit, by necessary consequence of law he shall have an action; and the current of all the books is so."" Ibid. (citation omitted).41 213 Blackstone considered it ""a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy, by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded."" 3 Blackstone *23. The generation of the Framers thought the principle so crucial that several States put it into their constitutions.42 And when Chief Justice Marshall asked about Marbury, ""If he has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country afford him a remedy?,"" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 162 (1803), the question was rhetorical, and the answer clear: 214 ""The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury. One of the first duties of government is to afford that protection. In Great Britain the king himself is sued in the respectful form of a petition, and he never fails to comply with the judgment of his court."" Id., at 163. 215 Yet today the Court has no qualms about saying frankly that the federal right to damages afforded by Congress under the FLSA cannot create a concomitant private remedy. The right was ""made for the benefit of"" petitioners; they have been ""hindered by another of that benefit""; but despite what has long been understood as the ""necessary consequence of law,"" they have no action, cf. Ashby, supra, at 55, 87 Eng. Rep., at 815. It will not do for the Court to respond that a remedy was never available where the right in question was against the sovereign. A State is not the sovereign when a federal claim is pressed against it, and even the English sovereign opened itself to recovery and, unlike Maine, provided the remedy to complement the right. To the Americans of the founding generation it would have been clear (as it was to Chief Justice Marshall) that if the King would do right, the democratically chosen Government of the United States could do no less.43 The Chief Justice's contemporaries might well have reacted to the Court's decision today in the words spoken by Edmund Randolph when responding to the objection to jurisdiction in Chisholm: ""[The Framers] must have viewed human rights in their essence, not in their mere form."" 2 Dall., at 423. V 216 The Court has swung back and forth with regrettable disruption on the enforceability of the FLSA against the States, but if the present majority had a defensible position one could at least accept its decision with an expectation of stability ahead. As it is, any such expectation would be naive. The resemblance of today's state sovereign immunity to the Lochner era's industrial due process is striking. The Court began this century by imputing immutable constitutional status to a conception of economic self-reliance that was never true to industrial life and grew insistently fictional with the years, and the Court has chosen to close the century by conferring like status on a conception of state sovereign immunity that is true neither to history nor to the structure of the Constitution. I expect the Court's late essay into immunity doctrine will prove the equal of its earlier experiment in laissez-faire, the one being as unrealistic as the other, as indefensible, and probably as fleeting. NOTES 217 1 The Court inexplicably protests that ""the right to trial by jury and the prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures ... derive from the common law,"" ante, at 23, but are nonetheless indefeasible. I cannot imagine how this could be thought relevant to my argument. These rights are constitutional precisely because they are enacted in the Sixth and Fourth Amendments, respectively, while the general prerogative of sovereign immunity appears nowhere in the Constitution. My point is that the common-law rights that were not enacted into the Constitution were universally thought defeasible by statute. 218 2 I am assuming that the Court does not put forward the theory of the ""fundamental aspect"" as a newly derived conception of its own, necessarily comprehended by the Tenth Amendment guarantee only as a result of logic independent of any intention of the Framers. Nor does the Court argue, and I know of no reason to suppose, that every legal advantage a State might have enjoyed at common law was assumed to be an inherent attribute of all sovereignties, or was constitutionalized wholesale by the Tenth Amendment, any more than the Ninth Amendment constitutionalized all common-law individual rights. 219 3 Bracton is the earliest source for the common-law immunity of the King, and his explanation is essentially practical: ""Si autem ab eo petatur, cum breve non currat contra ipsum, locus erit supplicationi, quod factum suum corrigat et emendet."" That is, ""If [justice] is asked of him, since no writ runs against him there will [only] be opportunity for a petition, that he correct and amend his act."" 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 33 (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne transl. 1968) (London 1569 ed., folio 5b, Bk. I, ch. 8). The fact that no writ ran against the King was ""no peculiar privilege; for no feudal lord could be sued in his own court."" 3 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 465 (3d ed. 1927). "" `He can not be compelled to answer in his own court, but this is true of every petty lord of every petty manor; that there happens to be in this world no court above his court is, we may say, an accident.' "" See Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415, n. 6 (1979) (quoting 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of English Law 518 (2d ed. 1899)). It was this same view of the immunity that came down to Blackstone, who cited Finch for the view that the King must be petitioned and not sued. See H. Finch, Law, or a Discourse Thereof, in Four Books 255 (1678 ed. reprinted 1992) (""Here in place of action against the King petition must be made unto him in the Chancery, or in Parliament, for no action did ever lie against the K[ing] at the Common Law, but the party is driven to his petition"" (omitted)); 1 Blackstone *242. 220 4 As I explain, infra this page and 8-9, this common-law conception of sovereign immunity differed from the natural-law version, which understood immunity as derived from the fact that the sovereign was the font of the law, which could not bind him. I do not dispute, indeed I insist, that in England it was the common-law version that existed, and so it is beside the point for the Court to protest that the King could not be sued under French law in his own courts, see ante, at 25; naturally not, since the common-law conception was not couched in terms of who was the font of the law. This said, I note that it is surprising for the Court to say that ""[i]t is doubtful whether the King was regarded ... as the font of the traditions and customs which formed the substance of the common law,"" ibid. Although Bracton said that ""law makes the king,"" 2 Bracton, at 33, he also said that the unwritten law of England could properly be called law only to the extent that ""the authority of the king or prince [has] first beenadded thereto,"" id., at 19, and he spoke of ""these English laws and customs, by the authority of kings,"" id., at 21. The judges who announced the common law sat ""in the place of the king,"" id., at 20, and so in practice the common law certainly derived from him. Thus, at least for the most part, ""[t]he custom of the king's court is the custom of England, and becomes the common law."" 1 Pollock & Maitland, supra n. 3, at 184. But for this, Blackstone would probably not have remarked that the natural law theory produced a result ""consonant"" with the common law, 1 Blackstone *243; see infra this page and 9. 221 5 For the original of the quoted passage, see 1 S. Pufendorf, De Jure Naturae et Gentium Libri Octo 915 (1688 ed. reprinted 1934); for a modern translation, see 2 S. Pufendorf, De Jure Naturae et Gentium Libri Octo 1344-1345 (transl. C. & W. Oldfather 1934) (hereinafter Pufendorf). Elsewhere in the same chapter, Pufendorf expressly derives the impossibility of enforcing a King's promises against him from natural law theory: ""Therefore, since a king enjoys natural liberty, if he has discovered any fault in a pact of his making, he can of his own authority serve notice upon the other party that he refuses to be obligated by reason of that fault; nor does he have to secure of the other [party to the pact] a release from a thing [namely, the pact] which, of its own nature, is incapable of producing an obligation or right."" Id., at 1342-1343. 222 6 The Court says that to call its approach ""natural law"" is ""an apparent attempt to disparage,"" ante, at 50. My object, however, is not to call names but to show that the majority is wrong, and in doing that it is illuminating to explain the conceptual tradition on which today's majority draws, one that can be traced to the Court's opinion from its origins in Roman sources. I call this conception the ""natural law"" view of sovereign immunity, despite the historical ambiguities associated with the term, because the expression by such figures as Pufendorf, Hobbes, and Locke, of the doctrine that the sovereign might not be sued, was associated with a concept of sovereignty itself derived from natural law. See Pufendorf 1103-1104; T. Hobbes, Leviathan Part 2, chs. 17-18 (1651), in 23 Great Books of the Western World 99-104 (1952) (hereinafter Leviathan) (describing sovereignty as the result of surrender of individual natural rights to single authority); J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §§ 95-99 (1690 J. Gough ed. 1947) (describing political community formed by individual consent out of a state of nature). The doctrine that the sovereign could not be sued by his subjects might have been thought by medieval civil lawyers to belong to jus gentium, the law of nations, which was a type of natural law; or perhaps in its original form it might have been understood as a precept of positive, written law. The earliest source for this conception is a statement of Ulpian's recorded in the Digest, I.3.31, and much interpreted by medieval jurists, ""Princeps legibus solutus est""; ""The emperor is not bound by statutes."" See 1 The Digest of Justinian 13 (T. Mommsen & P. Krueger eds., A. Watson transl. 1985); Tierney, The Prince Is Not Bound by the Laws: Accursius and the Origins of the Modern State, 5 Comparative Studies in Society and History 378 (1963); K. Pennington, The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600: Sovereignty and Rights in the Western Legal Tradition 77-79 (1993). Through its reception and discussion in the continental legal tradition, where it related initially to the Emperor, but also eventually to a King, to the Pope, and even to a city-state, see id., at 90, this conception of sovereign immunity developed into a theoretical model applicable to any sovereign body. Thus Hobbes could begin his discussion of the subject by saying, ""The sovereign of a Commonwealth, be it an assembly or one man, is not subject to the civil laws."" Leviathan ch. 26, p. 130. There is debate on the degree to which different medieval interpreters of the maxim Princeps legibus solutus est understood natural or divine law to limit the prince's freedom from the statutes. See Tierney, supra, at 390-394; Pennington, supra, at 206-208; J. Canning, The Political Thought of Baldus de Ubaldis 74-79 (1987). 223 7 A better formulation would have clarified that sovereignty resided in the King in Parliament, which was the dominant view by the later 17th century. See, e.g., G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787, p. 347 (1969). 224 8 The Court claims that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was ""universal in the States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified,"" ante, at 5, but the examples of Connecticut and Rhode Island suggest that this claim is overstated. It is of course true that these States' preservation without comment of their colonial suability could be construed merely as a waiver of sovereign immunity, and not as a denial of the principle. But in light of these States' silence as to any change in their status as suable bodies, it would be tendentious so to understand it. The Court relies for its claim on Justice Iredell's statement in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), that there was ""no doubt"" that no State had "" `any particular Legislative mode, authorizing a compulsory suit for the recovery of money against a State ... either when the Constitution was adopted, or at the time the judicial act was passed.' "" Ante, at 5 (quoting Chisholm, supra, at 434-435). But as the cases of Rhode Island and Connecticut demonstrate, Justice Iredell was simply wrong. As I have had occasion to say elsewhere, that an assertion of historical fact has been made by a Justice of the Court does not make it so. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 107, n. 5 (1996) (dissenting opinion). 225 9 The Court seems to think I have overlooked this point, that the exceptions imply a rule, see ante, at 15 (provisions for chancery petitions ""only confir[m]"" immunity enjoyed by these States). The reason for canvassing the spectrum of state thought and practice is not to deny the undoubted place of sovereign immunity in most States' courts, but to examine what turns out to be the scanty evidence that the States understood sovereign immunity in the indefeasible, civilian, natural law sense, necessary to support the Court's position here. 226 10 In a suit against Virginia in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County, Virginia pleaded sovereign immunity in natural law terms, and the sheriff was excused from making return of the writ attaching Virginia's goods, see Nathan v. Virginia, 1 Dall. 77, n. (1781), but this was only after the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth had already ordered the goods returned and, in any event, involved the immunity of one State in the courts of another, and not the distinct immunity of a State in her own courts, see Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 414. 227 11 Whether this formulation was a constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity or an affirmative repudiation of its applicability is uncertain, but the broad language opening the courts to all suits, and the apparent desire to exceed the previously available statutory scheme, would appear to support the latter interpretation. 228 12 The Court says, ""the founders' silence is best explained by the simple fact that no one, not even the Constitution's most ardent opponents, suggested the document might strip States of the immunity."" Ante, at 31-32. In fact, a stalwart supporter of the Constitution, James Wilson, laid the groundwork for just such a view at the Pennsylvania Convention, see infra, at 18-19. For the most part, it is true, the surviving records of the ratifying conventions do not suggest that much thought was given to the issue of suit against States in their own courts. But this silence does not tell us that the Framers' generation thought the prerogative so well settled as to be an inherent right of States, and not a common-law creation. It says only that at the conventions, the issue was not on the participants' minds because the nature of sovereignty was not always explicitly addressed. 229 13 In Seminole Tribe, I explained that Hamilton had in mind state sovereign immunity only with respect to diversity cases applying state contract law. See 517 U. S., at 145-149 (dissenting opinion). Here I intend simply to point out that with respect to state law, in the main Hamilton spoke consistently with deriving sovereign immunity from a natural law model. That he did so is consistent with his focus on state law; Hamilton almost certainly knew that the natural law theory of sovereign immunity extended only to rights created by the sovereign, and so would not have applied to federal-question claims against a State in either state or federal court. Thus when the Court claims that subjecting States to suit in state court ""would turn on its head the concern of the founding generation--that Article III might be used to circumvent state-court immunity"" ante, at 34, it has failed to realize that even those Framers who, like Hamilton, aimed to preserve state sovereign immunity, had in mind only state immunity on state-law claims, not federal questions. 230 14 Pufendorf's discussion of sovereign immunity, just before the passage quoted by Blackstone, begins (in a modern translation): ""Now although promises and pacts are as binding upon the conscience of a king as upon that of any private citizen, there is, nevertheless, this difference between the obligation of a king and that of subjects, namely, that it is no trouble for the former to exact what is owed him from a subject, when he demurs, while a citizen, so long as he remains such, has no means within his power to recover his due from a king against his will."" 2 Pufendorf 1344-1345. 231 15 Madison seems here to have overlooked the possibility of concurrent jurisdiction between the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction and that of state courts. 232 16 The Court says this statement of Wilson's is ""startling even today,"" ante, at 15, but it is hard to see what is so startling, then or now, about the proposition that, since federal law may bind state governments, the state governments are in this sense subordinate to the national. The Court seems to have forgotten that one of the main reasons a Constitutional Convention was necessary at all was that under the Articles of Confederation Congress lacked the effective capacity to bind the States. The Court speaks as if the Supremacy Clause did not exist, or McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), had never been decided. 233 Nor is the Court correct to say that the views of Wilson, Randolph, and General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, see n. 17, infra, ""cannot bear the weight"" I put upon them, ante, at 15. Indeed, the yoke is light, since I intend these Framers only to do their part in showing that a diversity of views with respect to sovereignty and sovereign immunity existed at the several state conventions, and that this diversity stands in the way of the Court's assumption that the founding generation understood sovereign immunity in the natural law sense as indefeasibly ""fundamental"" to statehood. 234 Finally, the Court calls Wilson's view ""a radical nationalist vision of the constitutional design,"" ante, at 15, apparently in an attempt to discount it. But while Wilson's view of sovereignty was indeed radical in its deviation from older conceptions, this hardly distanced him from the American mainstream, and in October 1787, Washington himself called Wilson ""as able, candid, & honest a member as any in Convention,"" 5 Papers of George Washington: Confederation Series 379 (W. Abbot & D. Twohig eds. 1997). 235 17 Nor was Wilson alone in this theory. At the South Carolina Convention, General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who had attended the Philadelphia Convention, took the position that the States never enjoyed individual and unfettered sovereignty, because the Declaration of Independence was an act of the Union, not of the particular States. See 4 Elliot's Debates 301. In his view, the Declaration ""sufficiently confutes the ... doctrine of the individual sovereignty and independence of the several states... . The separate independence and individual sovereignty of the several states were never thought of by the enlightened band of patriots who framed this Declaration; the several states are not even mentioned by name in any part of it,--as if it was intended to impress this maxim on America, that our freedom and independence arose from our union, and that without it we could neither be free nor independent."" Ibid. 236 18 ""[T]he grand objection, that the states were made subject to the action of an individual, still remained for several years, notwithstanding the concurring dissent of several states at the time of accepting the constitution."" St. G. Tucker, 1 Blackstone's Commentaries with Notes of Reference to the Constitution and Laws of the Federal Government of the United States; and of the Commonwealth of Virginia, App. 352 (1803). In a footnote, Tucker specified that ""[t]he several conventions of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Virginia, and North Carolina, proposed amendments in this respect."" Ibid. The proposed amendments of the latter four States, which may be found in Elliot's Debates, are discussed immediately infra, at 21-23. The extant published versions of the proposed amendments of Massachusetts and New Hampshire do not include such a proposed amendment. See, e.g., 1 Elliot's Debates, 322-323 (nine proposed amendments of Massachusetts); 2 id., at 177-178 (same); H. R. Doc. No. 398, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 1018-1020 (1927) (same); 1 Elliot's Debates, 325-326 (12 proposed amendments of New Hampshire); H. R. Doc. No. 398, supra, at 1025-1026 (same). 237 19 It is conceivable that the New York Convention, which was after all the intended audience for The Federalist, thought that the States had some sort of an inherent right against being sued in federal court. But this is unlikely, because numerous other of the proposed amendments declared so-called ""rights"" in no uncertain terms, see, e.g., 1 Elliot's Debates 328 (""[T]he people have an equal, natural, and unalienable right freely and peaceably to exercise their religion""; trial by jury is ""one of the greatest securities to the rights of a free people""; ""[T]he people have a right peaceably to assemble together""), whereas the proposed amendment regarding suits against States simply stated that the judicial power ""does not extend ... to authorize any suit by any person against a state,"" and said nothing about any rights, inherent or otherwise. Id., at 329. 238 20 The Court says ""there is no evidence that [the proposed amendments] were directed toward the question of sovereign immunity or that they reflect an understanding that the States would be subject to private suits without consent under Article III as drafted."" Ante, at 15. No evidence, that is, except the proposed amendments themselves, which would have omitted the Citizen-State Diversity Clause. If the proposed omission is not evidence going to sovereign immunity to private suits, one wonders what would satisfy the Court. 239 21 The case had first been brought before the Federal Circuit Court for the District of Georgia, over which Justice Iredell and District Judge Nathaniel Pendleton had presided. Ultimately, Justice Iredell held that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction in the case because Congress had not conferred such jurisdiction on it. See 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800, pp. 128-129, 154 (M. Marcus ed. 1994). Georgia had maintained that it was ""a free, sovreign, and independent State, and ... cannot be drawn or compelled, nor at any Time past hath been accustomed to be, or could be drawn or compelled to answer against the will of the said State of Georgia, before any Justices of the federal Circuit Court for the District of Georgia or before any Justices of any Court of Law or Equity whatever."" Plea to the Jurisdiction, Oct. 17, 1791, id., at 143. Chisholm demurred to the plea on the apparent ground that while the plea alleged that Georgia could not be compelled to appear before any court, Article III expressly declared that the federal judicial power extended to all controversies between a State and citizens of another State. Demurrer, id., at 144. In his unreported opinion, Justice Iredell dispensed with this demurrer. He first stated that the plea sufficiently alleged that the District Court lacked jurisdiction. Id., at 150. He added that in any case, the existence of Congress's constitutional authority to create courts to hear controversies between a State and citizens of another State did not mean that Congress had in fact created such courts. Id., at 151. Third, Justice Iredell pointed out that the right to create courts for cases in which a State was a party did not mean that Congress could confer jurisdiction in cases like the one at bar, because the word ""controversies"" in Article III might refer only to situations ""where such controversies could formerly have been maintained"" in state court. Since ""under the jurisdiction of a particular State Sovereigns may be liable in some instances but not in others,"" just as ""[i]n England the property in possession of the crown can be affected by an adverse Process, tho' certainly the King cannot be sued for the recovery of a sum of money,"" ibid., it appeared to Justice Iredell that under some conditions Article III did not authorize suits against States. 240 22 Framer but not signer. 241 23 Justice Wilson hinted that in his own private view, citizens of the States had not conferred sovereignty in the sense of absolute authority upon their state governments, because they had retained some rights to themselves: ""[A]ccording to some writers, every State, which governs itself without any dependence on another power, is a sovereign State. Whether, with regard to her own citizens, this is the case of the State of Georgia; whether those citizens have done, as the individuals of England are said, by their late instructors, to have done, surrendered the Supreme Power to the State or Government, and reserved nothing to themselves; or whether, like the people of other States, and of the United States, the citizens of Georgia have reserved the Supreme Power in their own hands; and on that Supreme Power have made the State dependent, instead of being sovereign; these are questions, to which, as a Judge in this cause, I can neither know nor suggest the proper answers; though, as a citizen of the Union, I know, and am interested to know, that the most satisfactory answers can be given."" Chisholm, 2 Dall. 457, at (1793) (citation omitted). 242 24 The basis for the dictum may be found earlier in the opinion, where Justice Iredell explained that it was uncertain whether Article III's extension of the federal judicial power to cases between a State and citizens of another State ""is to be construed as intending merely a transfer of jurisdiction from one tribunal to another, or as authorizing the Legislature to provide laws for the decision of all possible controversies in which a State may be involved with an individual, without regard to any prior exemption."" Id., at 436. Justice Iredell seems to have believed that Article III authorized only the former; in other words, that the Framers intended to permit Article III jurisdiction in suits against a State only where some other existing court could also hear such a claim. Because in Justice Iredell's view, state courts could nowhere hear suits against a State at the time of ratification, see id., at 434-435, it followed that Article III probably did not authorize such suits. Justice Iredell's reasoning, it must be said, differed markedly from the reasoning the Court adopts today. Justice Iredell believed simply that the Clause in Article III extending jurisdiction to controversies between a State and citizens of another State did not confer any extra law-making authority on Congress that was not found elsewhere in the Constitution. Because he could conceive of no other constitutional provision authorizing Congress to create a private right of action against a State, he concluded that none could exist. Today, of course, it is established that the commerce power authorizes Congress to create private rights as against the States. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). The Court today takes the altogether different tack of arguing that state immunity from suit in state court was an inherent right of States preserved by the Tenth Amendment. Whatever Justice Iredell might have thought of this argument, it gets no support from his opinion. 243 25 It only makes matters worse for the Court that two States, New York and Maryland, voluntarily subjected themselves to suit in the Supreme Court around the time of Chisholm. See Marcus & Wexler, Suits Against States: Diversity of Opinion In The 1790s, 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist. 73, 74-78. At the Court's February Term, 1791, before Chisholm, Maryland entered a plea (probably as to the merits) in Van Staphorst v. Maryland, see 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist., at 74, a suit brought by a foreign citizen for debts owed by the State, but then settled the suit to avoid the establishment of an adverse precedent on immunity, see id., at 75. In Oswald v. New York, an action that commenced before Chisholm but that was continued after it, New York initially objected to jurisdiction, see 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist., at 77, but the suit was tried to a jury in the Supreme Court, and after New York lost, it paid the full jury verdict out of the State's treasury, id., at 78. 244 26 The Court thinks that Justice Iredell's adversion to state practice gives reason to think so, see ante, at 11 (""[D]espite the opinion of Justice Iredell, the majority failed to address ...""). Even if Justice Iredell had been right about state practice, failure to respond to a specific argument raised by another Justice (as opposed to counsel) has even less significance with respect to this early Supreme Court opinion than it would have today, because the Justices may not have afforded one another the opportunity to read their opinions before they were announced. See 1 J. Goebel, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise: History of the Supreme Court of the United States, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, p. 728 (1971) (""There are hints ... that there may have been no conference and that each Justice arrived at his conclusion independently without knowing what each of his brethren had decided""). Indeed, since ""opinions were given only orally in the Supreme Court in the 1790s,"" 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court, supra n. 21, at 164, n., it is possible that the opinion as reported by Dallas followed a document prepared by Wilson after the oral announcement of the opinion, ibid.; see also id., at xxiv-xxv, in which case it is possible that the other Justices never heard certain arguments until publication. 245 27 The circumlocution ""another State, whose will must be always dear to me,"" Chisholm, 2 Dall., at 419, hints at Randolph's home State. It seems odd to suggest that Randolph's acknowledgment of the unpopularity of his position in two States would somehow support the thought that the view was incorrect. Randolph himself had urged the same position at the Virginia ratifying convention, see supra, at 16-17, and so knew perfectly well that Virginia had ratified with full knowledge that his position might be the law. 246 28 It is interesting to note a case argued in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1798, in which counsel for the Commonwealth urged a version of the point that the Court makes here, and said that ""[t]he language of the amendment, indeed, does not import an alteration of the Constitution, but an authoritative declaration of its true construction."" Respublica v. Cobbet, 3 Dall. 467, 472 (Pa. 1798). The Court expressly repudiated the historical component of this claim in an opinion by its Chief Justice: ""When the judicial law [i.e., the Judiciary Act of 1789] was passed, the opinion prevailed that States might be sued, which by this amendment is settled otherwise."" Id., at 475 (M'Kean, C. J.). 247 29 The Court might perhaps respond that if the role of state sovereign immunity was not the subject of universal consensus in 1792, the enactment of the Eleventh Amendment brought the doctrine into the constitutional realm. The strongest form of this view must maintain that, notwithstanding the Amendment's silence regarding state courts and its exclusive focus on the federal judicial power, the motivation of the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment must have been affirmatively to embrace the position that the States enjoyed the immunity from suit previously enjoyed by the Crown. On this account, the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment said nothing about sovereign immunity in state court because it never occurred to them that such immunity could be questioned; had they thought of this possibility, they would have considered it absurd that States immune in federal court could be subjected to suit in their own courts. 248 The first trouble with this view is that it assumes that the Eleventh Amendment was intended to reach all federal law suits, and not only those arising under diversity jurisdiction. If the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment had in mind only diversity cases, as the Court was prepared to concede in Seminole Tribe, see 517 U. S., at 69-70 (""The text dealt in terms only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm ... . [I]t seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of federal-question jurisdiction over the States""), then it might plausibly follow that the Framers of that Amendment assumed that States possessed sovereign immunity in their own courts with respect to state law. But it certainly does not follow that the Amendment's authors would have thought that States enjoyed immunity in state court on questions of federal law. To accept this would require one to believe that the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment were blind to an extremely anomalous application of sovereign immunity, under which a State is immune even when it is not the font of the law under which it is sued, cf. infra, at 39, 41. The Court today may labor under the misapprehension that sovereign immunity can apply where the sovereign is not the font of law, but the Court adduces no evidence to suggest that the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment held such a view. And the Framers were much closer than the Court to the theory of sovereign immunity according to which the font of law may not be subject to suit under that law. This leaves the Court in the position of supporting its view of what the Eleventh Amendment means by the ""historical"" assertion that the Framers must have intended it to mean the same. 249 30 The temptation to look to the natural law conception had shown up occasionally before Justice Holmes's appointment, and goes back at least to Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527 (1858), in which Chief Justice Taney wrote for the Court that ""[i]t is an established principle of jurisprudence in all civilized nations that the sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts, or in any other, without its consent and permission,"" id., at 529. But nothing turned on this pronouncement, because the outcome in the case would have been the same had sovereign immunity been understood as a common-law property of the States. In Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122 (1869), Justice Davis wrote that ""[e]very government has an inherent right to protect itself against suits ... . The principle is fundamental, [and] applies to every sovereign power ... ."" Id., at 126. This description came in dicta, and the origin of the immunity had no bearing on the decision. Justice Bradley quoted both Hamilton and Chief Justice Taney in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 13, 17 (1890), but nothing there depended on the natural law approach, and in the main the opinion, whatever its other demerits, see Seminole Tribe, supra, at 119 (Souter, J. dissenting), understood state sovereign immunity as a common-law concept, see Hans, supra, at 16 (""The suability of a State without its consent was a thing unknown to the law""). And the Court in Seminole Tribe may possibly have intended to hint at the natural law background of sovereign immunity when it said approvingly that the decision in Hans "" `found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental ""jurisprudence in all civilized nations."" ' "" Seminole Tribe, supra, at 69 (quoting Hans, supra, at 17, in turn quoting Beers v. Arkansas, supra, at 529). The Court's occasional seduction by the natural law view should not, however, obscure its basic adherence to the common-law approach. In United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196 (1882), the Court explained that ""the doctrine is derived from the laws and practices of our English ancestors,"" id., at 205, and added approvingly that the petition of right ""has been as efficient in securing the rights of suitors against the crown in all cases appropriate to judicial proceedings, as that which the law affords to the subjects of the King in legal controversies among themselves,"" ibid. The Court went on to notice that at common law one reason given for sovereign immunity was the ""absurdity"" of the King's writ running against the King, id., at 206, but, recognizing the distinct situation in the United States, the Court admitted candidly that ""it is difficult to see on what solid foundation of principle the exemption from liability to suit rests,"" ibid. Even the dissent there discussed in great detail the common-law heritage of the doctrine. See id., at 227-234 (opinion of Gray, J.). 250 31 The authority of the view that Parliament's sovereignty must be indivisible had already been eroded in the decade before independence. Iredell himself, as early as 1774, rejected the applicability of the theory ""to the case of several distinct and independent legislatures each engaged within a separate scale and employed about different objects,"" in the course of arguing for the possibility of a kind of proto-federalist relationship between the Colonies and the King. Iredell, Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain, in 1 G. McRee, Life and Correspondence of James Iredell 205, 219 (1857, reprinted 1949); see Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution, at 224-225, and n. 64. 251 32 This is entirely consistent with, and indeed is a corollary of, the statement quoted by the Court that the States are "" `no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere.' "" Ante, at 4 (quoting The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (J. Madison)). The point is that matters subject to federal law are within the federal sphere, and so the States are subject to the general authority where such matters are concerned. 252 33 It is therefore sheer circularity for the Court to talk of the ""anomaly,"" ante, at 43, that would arise if a State could be sued on federal law in its own courts, when it may not be sued under federal law in federal court, Seminole Tribe, supra. The short and sufficient answer is that the anomaly is the Court's own creation: the Eleventh Amendment was never intended to bar federal-question suits against the States in federal court. The anomaly is that Seminole Tribe, an opinion purportedly grounded in the Eleventh Amendment, should now be used as a lever to argue for state sovereign immunity in state courts, to which the Eleventh Amendment by its terms does not apply. 253 34 Perhaps as a corollary to its view of sovereign immunity as to some degree indefeasible because ""fundamental,"" the Court frets that the ""power to press a State's own courts into federal service to coerce the other branches of the State ... is the power first to turn the State against itself and ultimately to commandeer the entire political machinery of the State against its will and at the behest of individuals."" Ante, at 40. But this is to forget that the doctrine of separation of powers prevails in our Republic. When the state judiciary enforces federal law against state officials, as the Supremacy Clause requires it to do, it is not turning against the State's executive any more than we turn against the Federal Executive when we apply federal law to the United States: it is simply upholding the rule of law. There is no ""commandeering"" of the State's resources where the State is asked to do no more than enforce federal law. 254 35 Furthermore, the very idea of dignity ought also to imply that the State should be subject to, and not outside of, the law. It is surely ironic that one of the loci classici of Roman law regarding the imperial prerogative begins with (and is known by) the assertion that it is appropriate to the Emperor's dignity that he acknowledge (or, on some readings, at least claim) that he is bound by the laws. See Digna Vox, Justinian's Code 1.4.14 (""Digna vox maiestate regnantis legis alligatum se principem profiteri"") (""It is a statement worthy of the majesty of the ruler for the Prince to profess himself bound by the laws""); see Pennington, The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600, at 78, and n. 6. 255 36 The Court also claims that subjecting States to suit puts power in the hands of state courts that the State may wish to assign to its legislature, thus assigning the state judiciary a role ""foreign to its experience but beyond its competence . . . ."" Ante, at 43. This comes perilously close to legitimizing political defiance of valid federal law. 256 37 In its discussion of Hilton, the Court attempts to explain away the State's failure to raise a sovereign immunity defense by acknowledging candidly that when that case was decided, ""it may have appeared to the State that Congress' power to abrogate its immunity from suit in any court was not limited by the Constitution at all."" Ante, at 27. The reasoning of Hilton suggests that it appeared not only to the State, but also to the Court, that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity in state court. If Congress could not, then there would have been no jurisdiction in the case. The Court never even hinted that constitutional structure, much less the Tenth Amendment, might bar the suit, even though the dissent stressed that ""the principle of federalism underlying the [Eleventh] Amendment pervades the constitutional structure,"" 502 U. S., at 209 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). 257 38 Nor does Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 270 (1885), one of the Virginia Coupon Cases, fit comfortably with the assumption that state courts have exercised no disputed jurisdiction over their own governments on federal questions. Under its Funding Act of 1871, Virginia had issued bonds that specified on their face that the attached coupons should be receivable at and after maturity for all taxes, debts, dues, and demands due the State. Id., at 278. In 1882, however, Virginia passed a law requiring its tax collectors to accept nothing but gold, silver, or currency in payment of taxes. Id., at 275. After the bonds reached maturity, Poindexter used them to pay state property taxes; Greenhow, the local tax collector, ignored the payment and took possession of an office desk in Poindexter's possession to sell it for unpaid taxes. Poindexter brought a common-law action in detinue against the tax collector in state court for recovery of the desk, arguing that the later Virginia statute barring use of the coupons violated the Contracts Clause. Greenhow defended, inter alia, on the theory that the suit was ""substantially an action against the State of Virginia, to which it has not assented."" Id., at 285. The Court rejected this claim by applying to the State of Virginia reasoning akin to, though broader than, that later adopted in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). We held that, where state legislative action is unconstitutional, it ""is not the word or deed of the State, but is the mere wrong and trespass of those individual persons who falsely speak and act in its name,"" 114 U. S., at 290. Because the original bonds were binding contracts, the obligation of which Virginia could not constitutionally impair, ""[t]he true and real Commonwealth which contracted the obligation is incapable in law of doing anything in derogation of it."" Id., at 293. It therefore could not be argued that the tax collector was acting on behalf of the State, because ""[t]he State of Virginia has done none of these things with which this defence charges her. The defendant in error is not her officer, her agent, or her representative, in the matter complained of, for he has acted not only without her authority, but contrary to her express commands."" Ibid. Although the tax collector had done nothing more than collect taxes under duly enacted state law, he was held to be liable to suit. Thus in the only case to have come before this Court specifically involving a claim of state sovereign immunity of constitutional magnitude in a State's own court, jurisdiction was upheld. 258 39 Garcia demonstrates that, contra the Court's suggestion, the FLSA does not impermissibly act upon the States, see ante, at 4. Rather, the FLSA, enacted lawfully pursuant to the commerce power, treats the States like other employers. The Court seems to have misunderstood Hamilton's statement in The Federalist No. 15 that the citizens are "" `the only proper objects of government,' "" ante, at 4 (quoting Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 919-920 (1997)). Hamilton's point is not, as the Court seems to think, that the National Government should dictate nothing to the States in order to protect their residual sovereignty. To the contrary, Hamilton, who was arguing against the extreme respect for state sovereignty in the Articles of Confederation, meant precisely that the National Government should not act as the leader of a ""league,"" The Federalist No. 15, p. 95 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), mediating among several sovereignties, but as a ""national government,"" ibid., with power to produce obedience through the ""COERCION of the magistracy,"" ibid. Hamilton is therefore the wrong person to quote for the proposition that the National Government may not act upon the States, since his point was that the National Government should not be limited to acting through the medium of the States. 259 40 The most recent available data give 4,732,608 as the total number of employees of the 50 States of the Union, see State Government Employment Data: March 1997, http:/www.census.gov/pub/govs/apes/ 97stus.txt. 260 41 The principle is even older with respect to rights created by statute, like the FLSA rights here, than it is for common-law damages. Lord Holt in fact argued that the well-established principle in the context of statutory rights applied to common law rights as well. See Ashby v. White, 6 Mod., at 54, 87 Eng. Rep., at 816 (""Now if this be so in case of an Act of Parliament, why shall not common law be so too? For sure the common law is as forcible as any Act of Parliament""). A still older formulation of the statutory right appears in a note in Coke's Reports: ""[W]hen any thing is prohibited by an Act, although that the Act doth not give an action, yet action lieth upon it."" 12 Co. Rep. 100. Coke's Institutes yield a similar statement: ""When any act doth prohibit any wrong or vexation, though no action be particularly named in the act, yet the party grieved shall have an action grounded upon this statute."" 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 117 (1797) (reprinted in 5B 2d Historical Writngs in Law and Jurisprudence (1986)). In our case, of course, the statute expressly gives an action. 261 42 See, e.g., A Declaration of Rights and Fundamental Rules of the Delaware State § 12 (1776), 2 Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions, at 197, 198; Md. Const. Art. XVII (1776), 4 id., at 372, 373; Mass. Const. Art. XI, (1780), 5 id., at 92, 94; Ky. Const. Art. XII, cl. 13 (1792), 4 id., at 142, 150; Tenn. Const. Art. XI, § 7 (1796), 9 id., at 141, 148. 262 43 Unfortunately, and despite the Court's professed ""unwilling[ness] to assume the States will refuse to honor the Constitution and obey the binding laws of the United States,"" ante, at 46, that presumption of the sovereign's good-faith intention to follow the laws has managed somehow to disappear in the intervening two centuries, despite the general trend toward greater, not lesser, government accountability. Anyone inclined toward economic theories of history may look at the development of sovereign immunity doctrine in this country and see that it has been driven by the great and recurrent question of state debt, both in the aftermath of Chisholm and in the last quarter of the 19th century, see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 120-122 (Souter, J., dissenting). And no matter what one may think of the quality of the legal doctrine that the problem of state debt has helped to produce, one can at least argue that States' periodic attempts to repudiate their debts were not purely or egregiously lawless, because those who held state-issued bonds may well have valued and purchased them with the knowledge that default was a real possibility. Maine's refusal to follow federal law in the case before us, however, is of a different order. Far from defaulting on debt to eyes-open creditors, Maine is simply withholding damages from private citizens to whom they appear to be due. Before Seminole Tribe was decided, petitioners here were the beneficiaries of a District Court ruling to the effect that they were entitled to some coverage, and hence to some amount of damages, under the FLSA. Mills v. Maine, 839 F. Supp. 3 (Me. 1993). Before us, Maine has not claimed that petitioners are not covered by the FLSA, but only that it is protected from suit. Indeed, Maine acknowledges that it may be sued by the United States in federal court for damages on the very same claim, Brief for Respondent 12-13, and we are told that Maine now pays employees like petitioners overtime as covered by the FLSA, id., at 3. Why the State of Maine has not rendered this case unnecessary by paying damages to petitioners under the FLSA of its own free will remains unclear to me. The Court says that ""it is conceded by all that the State has altered its conduct so that its compliance with federal law cannot now be questioned."" Ante, at 50. But the ambiguous qualifier ""now"" allows the Court to avoid the fact that whatever its forward-looking compliance, the State still has not paid damages to petitioners; had it done so, the case before us would be moot."
7,American Print Works v. Laurence (N.J. 1851) 238 n. 133,True,"These causes are now, for the second time, before this court. Upon a former occasion, they came up upon demurrer to a plea of the defendant, who set up, as a justification of the act charged to be a trespass, that it was done by him, as mayor of the city of New York, under the authority and in pursuance of a statute of the state of New York, by which certain duties were imposed upon him as such officer. He pleaded in justification, that the act was done by him in the performance of the duties imposed upon him by the statute, and by virtue of the authority so given, as he alleged it was lawful for him to do. This plea of justification rested upon the statute, and the defence so set up was sustained by the Supreme Court of this state, upon the authority of decisions in the courts of New York, in a series of cases arising out of the very act here charged to be a trespass. But this court reversed the decision of the Supreme Court, and overruled the plea because it rested upon the statute alone, which the court held, so far as it attempted to confer any power over personal property for which it made no compensation, to be unconstitutional and void. Dissenting from the view taken by the courts of New York, this court held that the statute was not a mere regulation of a pre-existing natural right, but a grant of a new power to take or destroy private property for public use or public safety; and taking this view of the statute, that it was constitutional only so far as it provided compensation for the property destroyed. The judgment of this court, perhaps in strictness, went no farther, looking only at the point necessarily involved in the decision, though the opinion delivered may have assumed some other and additional principles. By that decision, this court held that the statute of the state-of New York to be so far unconstitutional, notwithstanding that the constitution of the state of New York was not before us by pleading, of which, therefore, we could not properly take judicial cognizance, aud notwithstanding that the statute had there been sustained as valid in every respect in which it had been presented for consideration. I say, notwithstanding that it had been held by the courts of New York to be a coustitu*596tional and valid law, it was here held to be unconstitutional and void, and to afford no justification to a public officer acting under its provisions and in strict obedience to its mandates. I have before expressed my earnest dissent from that decision, not because I would give a different construction to the statute, were its primary construction the proper subject of our consideration. As I then intimated, I should be disposed to treat a similar statute of this state, were any such to. be enacted, as a grant of power. But I could not unite in a decision placing a construction upon a statute of the state of New York different from that adopted by the courts of New York. I could not hold the statute to be unconstitutional and void, when it had never been so declared by the courts of the state to which its interpretation primarily belonged, but on the other hand had been expressly held to be constitutional in a cause arising entirely within that state, and which I thought ought to be regulated strictly by the lex loci. Upon what authority or principle could we assume the exercise of such a power? It has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, that court refusing to declare am act of a state legislature void because of its conflict with the constitution of the state. Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 280; Watson et al. v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, (109). The question, whether a state law is constitutional or not, on the ground of repugnancy to a state constitution, is not cognizable by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is exclusively confined to the state courts, and obviously to the courts of the state by whom the act was passed, at any rate in regard to all causes of action arising within such state. Indeed, the Supreme Court of the United States (as I have already on a previous occasion remarked), in all controversies arising under the statutes of the respective states, conforms to the decisions of the courts of those states in regard to the construction of their own statutes, so far as they comport with the constitution of the United States. In cases depending upon laws of a particular state, it uniformly adopts the construction which the courts of the state have given to those laws. “ This *597course,” says Chief Justice Marshall, “is founded on the principle, supposed to be universally recognized, that the judicial department of government, where such department exists, is the appropriate organ for construing the legislative acts of that government. Thus, no court in the universe, which professed to be governed by principle, would, we presume, undertake to say that the courts of Great Britain or France, or of any other nation, had misunderstood their own statutes, and therefore erect itself into a tribunal which should correct such misunderstanding. We receive the construction given by the courts of the nation as the true sense of the law, and feel ourselves no more at liberty to depart from that construction than to depart from the words of the statute.” Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat. 152. This doctrine, so forcibly and justly expressed and so important to the proper working of our system of associated state governments under different laws, administered by different judicial tribunals, is to be found in almost any volume of the reports of that high tribunal, where it is acted upon as a settled rule. Some additional authorities to the point are collected in a recent decision of the District Court of Virginia. See Prentice v. Zane, 11 Boston Law Reporter 208. This court, and it is the first court so far as I know, has departed from this principle, and adopted some other rule. We have not received the construction of the statute given by the courts of the state of New York as the true sense of a law of their own state, but have taken the liberty to depart from that construction. We have undertaken to say that the courts of New York misunderstood one of their own statutes, and we have assumed the power to correct such -misunderstanding; and in all this, according to my judgment, we have most erroneously departed from a principle, supposed, by the eminent judge whose words I have cited, to be universally recognized, to wit, that the judicial department of each government is the appropriate organ for construing the legislative acts of that government. Sitting in this court of last resort, I regard it as my duty, with all respect to those who may differ from me, to reiterate *598my views of the principles by which we ought to be guided iu the examination of the statute laws of other states; I regard them as first principles, which cannot be shaken by the erroneous decision of any court, whatever may be the effect of such decision upon a particular cause. But, passing the propriety of that decision, the case as now presented (I treat them as one) offers quite another question. There are two special pleas, the validity of which is now the subject of discussion. These pleas are not demurred to, but the plaintiff has filed replications, to which the defendant has demurred. It may be proper here to remark, that the defendant has demurred specially to the replications filed by the plaintiff; and of course this brings up for consideration every exception taken, even to the form of these replications. But, as the plaintiff has pleaded over, no exception to the pleas is open to him but for error in substance, and such as would be available on general demurrer. The first special plea sets up the statute of New York, and the duty imposed by that statute upon the mayor of the city of New York, in order to stop the progress of any conflagration, with the consent and concurrence of' two aldermen, to direct any buildings likely to take fire, and convey fire to others, to be pulled down and destroyed. That the defendant, as mayor, acting under such advice and concurrence, did destroy certain buildings for that purpose which were peculiarly exposed to the fire, and but for his action would have been immediately burned up with their contents, and would have communicated the flames to adjoining buildings, unless instantly demolished. That the immediate destruction of these buildings was necessary, without waiting to remove the goods, in order to prevent the spread of the conflagration; and that at the time of the blowing up and destruction of the buildings, the goods could not have been removed or saved before the buildings would have taken fire, and communicated the flames to other buildings, and thereby endangered a great and valuable portion of the city, &e., wherefore the defendant says he did necessarily, in order to prevent, &e., blow up and destroy certain buildings, and in so doing did necessarily and una*599voidably blow up and destroy certain goods in the plaintiffs declaration mentioned, as it was lawful and necessary for him to do. This plea, to which I have referred in a general way only, justifies not on the ground of a common law necessity, but of a necessity, so to speak, arising out of a statute. It sets up that the mayor destroyed the buildings for the purpose of stopping the conflagration, under the advice and with the consent of two aldermen, in the performance of a duty imposed upon him by the statute. It sets up the duty imposed upon him by the statute, of destroying the buildings in which the goods were stored, and alleges that the goods could not have been removed and saved before the said buildings would have taken fire, and endangered and communicated the flames to other buildings; and that the said goods were, therefore, necessarily and unavoidably destroyed. Now, if the statute under which the buildings wmre destroyed was a constitutional and valid law in respect to the destruction of the buildings, and if the officer, in the discharge of a public duty, lawfully performed the act by which the buildings were destroyed, and the goods were necessarily and unavoidably destroyed in the performance of that duty, it seems to me that the plea sets up a good defence. If, under the exigencies of the imminent peril which at the time of the great fire threatened the city of New York, it was the duty of the mayor to order the immediate destruction of the buildings, as necessary for the preservation of the city, the necessity and authority of instantly blowing up the buildings involved the authority and necessity of blowing up their contents with them, if they could not be removed. Whatever may have been the view heretofore taken of the New York statute by this court, as to the authority thereby conferred to destroy goods, it has not been held, either here or elsewhere, that it is not a constitutional law, so far as regards the destruction of the buildings and to the extent to which provision has been made for compensation. ; The statute, as far as I understand the prior decision of this court, has only been held void pro tanto where it authorized destruction without providing compensation. In the destruction *600of the buildings, then, the defendant acted under a valid and constitutional law. Adopting the language of the court below, the real ground of complaint is, that the defendant exceeded the authority conferred by the statute, and thereby became a trespasser, because he destroyed not only the buildings which he might lawfully destroy, but also the plaintiff's goods., which were in the buildings, and which the statute, it is alleged, gave him no authority to destroy. Now for doing the lawful act of destroying the buidings, in order to arrest the conflagration, — an act which, in the exigencies of the case, was not only lawful, but the imperative duty of the defendant, as a public officer, to do, if the goods were unavoidably and necessarily destroyed, it not being possible to remove them but with the hazard of losing all the benefit to result from the act, the defendant ought not to, and cannot, be held liable. A public officer, acting in good faith upon a sudden and alarming emergency, under the sanction of a constitutional and valid law in a matter of public duty, is not to be held responsible for the unavoidable and necessary result of such act of duty. An injured party may have a right to resort to the public for satisfaction, but the law has ever held that the officer himself, not exceeding his power and not guilty of oppression or bad faith, is not personally liable. The Governor and Company, &c., v. Meredith, 4 T. R. 794; Sutton v. Clark, 6 Taunt. 29; Boulton v. Crowther, 2 B. & C. 703; Nevius, J., in Sinnickson v. Johnson, 2 Harr. 150; Nevius, J., in Ten Eyck v. Del. and Rar. Canal Co., 3 Harr. 203; Wilson v. The Mayor &c., of New York, 1 Denio 595; The Executors of Radcliff v. The Mayor, &c., of Brooklyn, lately decided in the Court of Appeals of New York, and not yet regularly reported. 4 Comst. 594. In the case in New York last cited, Chief Justice Bronson, who delivered the opinion of the court, remarked, that it would be absurd to say that public officers may be liable to an action for what they have done under lawful authority and in a proper manner. “ When the state,” said Justice Nevius, in another case, “authorizes an act to be done exclusively for the public interest, and appoints an agent to execute *601that act, and such agent shall act within the scope of his authority, he cannot be personally responsible to individuals for the consequences of executing his commission. Should private property be necessarily and unavoidably injured, taken away or destroyed, by the execution of such trust, without any compensation provided in the act itself, the remedy can only be by contesting the constitutionality of the law or appealing to the magnanimity of the legislature.” Sinnickson v. Johnson, 2 Harr. 150. In Ten Eyck v. The Del. and Rar. Canal Co., 3 Harr. 203, the same judge expressed like views, and held, that in case of public agents, the remedy cannot be against them, but only by an appeal to the justice of the legislature that directed the act. This doctrine, even to this extent, is not without the support of other high authority. Chancellor Kent said, that it is not to be understood that a statute assuming private property for public purposes without compensation is absolutely void, so as to render all persons acting in execution of it trespassers. Some of the judicial dicta seem to go that length, but others do not. But he thought the reasonable and practicable construction to be, that the statute would be prima facie good and binding, and sufficient to justiiy acts done under it, until a party was restrained by judicial process founded on the paramount authority of the constitution. 2 Kent 310, note, (5th ed.) Without expressing my opinion as to the extent or weight of this doctrine, though it seems to be highly reasonable, it is enough for the decision of this case that we recognize the well settled principle, that public officers, acting without private emolument in a matter of public concern, shall not be personally liable for the consequential injuries arising out of an act done by them under lawful authority and in a proper manner. Under the New York statute, the defendant, as mayor, was bound by duty to do what, according to the advice of two aldermen, was necessary to prevent the spread of the conflagration. The act which constituted them judges of the necessity of destroying the buildings, made them judges of the time at which the act of destruction became necessary. The plea avers that the buildings were destroyed at the time and in the man*602ner which the imminency of the danger demanded, and that the destruction of the buildings necessarily involved the destruction of the goods. The buildings being destroyed in the performance of a duty, which, as a public officer, the defendant was bound to undertake. The destruction of the goods was the unavoidable consequence of the destruction of the buildings. I deem it clear that the defendant ought not to be held personally responsible for the consequence of such act of duty, and that the plea sets up a sufficient defence. The second special plea is so framed as to set up a justification arising out of the common law doctrine of necessity, and it seeks no aid from the statute. It sets out that there was a fire raging in the city of New York, which threatened destruction to a large portion of the city; that certain buildings were peculiarly exposed and' likely to take fire, and communicate fire to other buildings, and but for the acts of the defendant, would have taken fire and communicated, &c.; that, to prevent the spread of the conflagration and the destruction of a large portion of the city, the immediate destruction of the said buildings was necessary, without waiting to remove the goods therein; and that for this purpose the defendant, a resident citizen and owner of valuable buildings in the city, caused the said buildings to be blown up, and did thereby necessarily and unavoidably destroy the goods, &c. The plea does not in terms aver that the goods were the cause of alarm and danger, and therefore the immediate object of destruction, but that necessity required the immediate destruction of the buildings, without waiting to remove the goods, which unavoidably involved the destruction of the goods. The plea sets up that the buildings and the goods were so connected, that the necessity of destroying the former, necessarily involved the destruction of the latter; and the justification is made to rest upon the ground, that the right to destroy the buildings must therefore include the right to destroy the goods. If, which I do not in the least doubt, there can be an imperious overwhelming necessity of instantly destroying buildings, without waiting to remove the goods stored therein, in order to prevent the spread of fire, I suppose this to be the *603mode in which that necessity must be pleaded, the goods themselves not being the cause of alarm or danger. The plea, therefore, does not seem to be obnoxious to the objection of argumentativeness. It is proper, however, to remark, that even if the plea were argumentative, it is an objection in point of form only, which cannot be raised by general demurrer. It would not be available, therefore, to the plaintiff in the present instance, all objections to mere form having been waived by pleading over. Gould’s Plead. 467-8, § 18. But the leading objection taken to this plea is, that it does not show any individual or personal interest in the defendant, nor any immediate overwhelming danger to him or his property. It is urged, that to make a valid plea, setting up the exercise of the right of necessity, the defendant must show that his own property was in imminent danger, and that the destruction was for the purpose of preserving it. That it is not enough that this defendant was a resident citizen of New York, owning property and having a general interest in the safety and welfare of the city, but that he could only so interpose when the act became absolutely necessary to preserve his own property from immediate destruction. I do not so understand the doctrine, as applied to that branch of the law of necessity now in question. Such limited view was certainly not taken by this court on the former review; on the contrary, the language used in the leading opinion would seem to lead to a very different conclusion. The right to take or destroy private property by an individual in self-defence, or for the protection of life, liberty, or property, was said to be a private, and not a public or official right. It was said, that it might be exercised by a single individual for his own personal safety or security, or for the preservation of his own property, or by a community of individuals, in the defence of their common safety or in the protection of their common rights. 1 Zab. 729. Again, in reply to the argument, that the destruction of the store and its contents, for which suit was brought, was not for the public use and benefit, in the sense in which those terms were used in the passage referred to, and therefore that the doctrine of *604eminent domain was not applicable, it was said : the position would be true, if not done under the authority of the statute, but by the defendant by virtue of his natural right, and in defence of his own or of his neighbor’s property, or by a number of individuals to prevent a common calamity that threatened a particular street or district, Ib. 738. The force of the argument here depends upon the doctrine implied, if not directly expressed, that an individual may, in the exercise of the common law right of necessity, take and destroy private property, not only in defence of his own but of his neighbor’s property, and that individuals in a community may so act to prevent a general calamity to that community, and in protection of their common rights. If it be asked, “ who is my neighbor, for whose benefit this right of charity and kindness, as well as of necessity, may be exercised?” let the necessity itself, for which it is intended to provide, be the answer. But the passages I have cited have been referred to, not so muon to establish the, view which it seems to me may reasonably be adduced therefrom, as to show that this court is now not committed, even by dicta, to the more limited rule contended for by the plaintiff in error. The common law doctrine of necessity is one that is now too firmly established to be drawn in question, and yet, perhaps, necessarily from its very character, it seems somewhat undefined as to its application and extent. It may, by the way, be remarked, that it is not less unquestionable as an established doctrine, because its origin, so far as regards a justification at the common law, is only to be found in the illustrative arguments of the older authorities, and not in any direct adjudication. Its exercise must depend upon the nature and degree of necessity that calls the right into action, and which cannot be determined until the necessity is made to appear. The necessity must be immediate, imperative, and in some cases extreme and overwhelming. Mere expediency or utility will not suffice. The doctrine seems to arrange itself under different heads, to which somewhat different rules will be applicable. The conservation of life is one of the occasions which will call it into exercise, of which the necessity of self-preservation *605is one of the marked and striking instances. Self preservation is one of the great rules of our being, implanted in us by our Creator, and recognised under this doctrine by the common law. The right to destroy property, or even life, when necessary for self-preservation, is ah admitted right. Thus, as an instance frequently referred to, if two men be on one plank, insufficient to save both, and one be thrust off and drowned, the homicide is excusable, indeed justifiable through unavoidable necessity, upon the great universal principle of self-preservation, 'which prompts every man to save his own life in preference to that of another, when 'one must inevitably perish. Noy’s Max. 25, 22. The taking of viands to satisfy urgent hunger, the necessity being made to appear, this is no felony or larceny. So a jail being on fire by casualty, and the prisoners are enabled to get out, this is no escape nor breaking of the prison. 15 Vin. 534. Again there is a necessity arising out of the act of God or of strangers, as of public enemies; and in regard to this, it is said, one man may justify committing the private injury for the public good. Instances are thus put in an old anthority. In time of war a man may justify making fortifications on another’s land without license; also a man may justify pulling down a house on fire for the safety of the neighboring houses; for these are cases of the common weal. Malwerer v. Spinke, Dyer 36, v. See also the Saltpeter case, 12 Co. 13; Mouse’s case, 12 Ib. 63, &c. The ground on which this necessity rests, it is seen, is placed on the principle, not of mere individual necessity, but of the public good. The right may, as in the former class, be a private, and not a public or official right; it may be one that appertains to individuals, and not to the state. But still the older authorities to which I have referred, and which are generally cited for the doctrine, place it, in these instances, not on the ground of the individual advantage of the actor, but of the common weal, in order to save the city. The case of pulling down a house in time of fire, is given as an act done for the public good. That brahch of the doctrine to which I now refer is, of course, to be distinguished from that mere appropriation for *606public utility under a general state necessity, and which comes within the doctrine of the eminent domain. They are both spoken of sometimes as grounded on necessity, and they doubtless are so. But the latter stands strongly distinguished from that urgent necessity which, for immediate preservation, imperatively demands immediate action. His case who should throw up trenches on his neighbor’s land for the protection of a town from an immediate hostile attack, as regards his justification, would certainly stand on a very different footing from one who, under the authority of law, should do the same act in order to guard the town from prospective and merely possible future harm. The one might be a private and unofficial act to protect the community, of which he was a part, from urgent danger; an act which might be justified under the doctrine of necessity, which for the common weal every man may do without an action. It is not necessary for my purpose to intimate any opinion as to whether., in the last case, the individual would or would not be personally responsible, but certainly the sufferer would come within the constitutional provision. The distinction between the cases, when the act was done under the pressure of threatening danger which it was necessary to avert, and when taken for the benefit of the public under a grant of power, was well put by Chief Justice Nelson, in one of the New York fire cases, arising under the statute so frequently referred to. “The one” (he says) “ presents a question of responsibility by a citizen acting under the influence of an overruling necessity solely for the public good, the decision turning not so much upon the want of merit in the claim for redress, as upon the injustice of making the defendant liable, who had thus acted for the benefit of the public. The other, the case upon the statute, is a question between the sufferer and the city for whose benefit his property has been sacrificed, when the authorities of the city are empowered to determine at discretion when and under what circumstances it shall be thus sacrificed.” The Mayor of New York v. Lord, 17 Wend. 290, 291. “ I entertain no doubt,” (says Justice Bronson in the same case) “ that in a case of necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire, magistrates or indi*607viduals may destroy private property without subjecting themselves to an action for damages. This is only one of the many cases where the maxim applies — Salus populi suprema lex.” 17 Ib. 297. Chancellor Kent places the rule on the same ground, and says it is lawful to raze houses to the ground in order to prevent the spread of a conflagration, because it is a case of urgent necessity, in which the rights of property must be made subservient to the public welfare. 2 Kent 338. I have cited these authorities to show that a distinction must bo made between the different branches of the law of necessity. The distinction must now be apparent between that overwhelming necessity which will justify one in the destruction of the person and property of another, and when the right is solely for the advantage of the actor, and that necessity which arises from the danger of conflagration in a great city, or other analogous instances, and which rests for its exercise upon the subservience of private rights to the public good. It may welL be that a person shall not justify the destruction of another, in order to save a stranger. An assault is only justifiable when committed in the defence of one’s self, or of those who stand in some near aud dear relation to the actor. The necessity of self-preservation, which is for the advantage of the actor, can have no wider foundation. The right being a personal one, it is reasonable to suppose that it can be exercised only by the party in danger for his own benefit, or, as would seem to be a reasonable conclusion, for the safety of husband or wife, parent or child. But‘can the same rule apply to the efforts which must so frequently be made to save a city from fire, and which rests upon a less restricted principle? There can certainly be no such limitation of the right as is inconsistent with the reason of the law and the object to be obtained by its exercise. In vain would the call be made on firemen and others to stay the progress of the flames, if the imminent danger of one’s own property could be the only justification of any necessary act of destruction in order to effect that object. If a man’s own property must first be in imminent peril, there would be an end to all efficient efforts to stay the progress of a conflagra* *608tion. I have no doubt the rule is otherwise. I think the second special plea is a good plea. The replications I consider to be clearly bad. To both pleas they set up new facts, and in both cases they tender a traverse upon facts not set up or denied by the pleas. Looking however at the main point, which it is urged is presented by these replications, that the immediate destruction of the goods was not necessary, such' defence is not set up in the pleas. The pleas are, in the one, that the buildings were lawfully, and in the other, that they were necessarily, destroyed in order to stop the progress of a conflagration, and that the destruction of the goods was the unavoidable and inevitable consequence, there not being time to remove them. The lawfulness or the necessity to destroy the buildings should have been denied by a special traverse of some material fact upon which he relied to show that the buildings were so destroyed, or by .setting up in the replication that the goods might have been removed. An issue upon either of these points, if decided in favor of the plaintiff, would be fatal to the defence. If the pleas are good, which I take them to be, the replications are bad. I am of the opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. Randolph, J. In the various suits in the state of New York, growing out of the great fire of 1835, the courts of that state have determined that the statute, directing the mayor and two aldermen to determine when a building should be destroyed to prevent the spread of a conflagration, was constitutional, and intended, merely to define and regulate the common law power of necessity, without giving any new power; that property destroyed in pursuance of the act was not taken under the right of .eminent domain for public use, but was destroyed under the right of necessity to prevent a great calamity; and that, consequently, the corporation of New York were only liable to the extent of the statute, viz. for damages in destroying the buildings, and the goods of such as had an interest in the buildings, and not liable for the goods destroyed belonging to the persons. 17 Wend. 235; 18 Ib. 126; 20 Ib. 139; 25 Ib. *609157; 2 Denio 461, and opinions of Oakley, J., in the Superior Court, and of Bronsou, J., in the Supreme Court, in the ease of Lawrence v. The Mayor, &c., of New York. No action seems to have been brought against the defendant personally, in the state of New York, for any act which he performed or directed during the fire; but, after the various opinions which had been given in the corporation cases, the plaintiffs in these suits (for there are a number of them depending on this one) thought proper to seek a foreign jurisdiction, not, it is presumed, because they sought to reverse the judgments of a state court upon its own statutes by the judiciary of another stale, but simply because, these actions being transitory in their nature, they preferred to have them brought here. To the declaration, charging the defendant with destroying the plaintiffs’ goods by gunpowder, the defendant pleads simj)ly in bar the statute of the state of New York, directing the mayor, &c., and two aldermen to destroy buildings to prevent the spread of conflagration, and that the goods were in one of the buildings so destroyed. Three justices of the Supreme Court, sitting in bank, decided unanimously that the plea was good. The cases were brought to this court by writ of error, and of the eight judges who heard the cause, five determined that the plea was bad, and three that it was good; the last-decision settled the case, although it presented the strange anomaly of being the decision of five members of the Court of Errors against the opinions of six members. The cases having been remanded, new pleas were filed, viz: 1. Not guilty. 2. Justification under the statute for destroying the buildings in which the goods were, and in doing so, the unavoidable necessity of destroying the goods therein, &e. 3. The common law plea of necessity. On the first plea issue is joined ; to the second and third, replications are put in, to which there are demurrers and joinders. These replications are not supported by the plaintiffs’ counsel, but are given up as defective. They are argumentative, double; they neither deny the allegations of the pleas, confess and avoid them, or set up new matter with a traverse, and they are bad, for nearly or quite all the causes assigned. These replications being thus disposed of, *610the next question is, are the pleas good. The third is the common law plea of necessity (Com. Dig. 3 M. 20 and 30; 3 Chit. 1118), that it was necessary to destroy the stores to prevent the spread of the conflagration, and- the goods now in controversy could not be removed or saved before the buildings would have taken fire, and that the defendant did “ necessarily and unavoidably blow up by gunpowder, burn and destroy, the said goods.” This plea is unquestionably good, and the plaintiffs should have taken issue thereon. It even avers, in accordance with the opinion delivered in this court, that the defendant was at the timé a resident aud owner of property in the city of New York, which must be considered altogether unnecessary, and was doubtless so considered at the time by the distinguished gentleman who drew these pleas; for when trying the case in the Essex Circuit, formerly alluded to, against Capt. Williamson for blowing up a building in the city of Newark to prevent the spread of fire, the plea of necessity was held by him a good justification of the defendant, although he was at the time a mere visitor in the place. A contrary doctrine would make every fireman, captain of a ship, or sailor, a trespasser for acts done in extreme necessity, or prevent all action in the severest calamities, except by persons immediately interested. The law knows no such distinction ; it looks to the act, not to the actbr; to the necessity of the transaction, not to the character or interest of him who performs the deed. On this plea, certainly, the defendant is entitled to judgment. There is more difficulty in the second plea, which arises principally from the former decision of this court. It is conceded, by defendant’s counsel, that if the plea is. the same in substance as that formerly overruled, it cannot be sustained. This no doubt is correct; the decisions of this court, the highest in the state, constitute the law on the subject, until altered or reversed by the same court or changed by the legislature. The plea which this court overruled was simply a plea of justification under the Now York statute, that the defendant and two alderman, in order to prevent the spread of conflagration,. *611caused to be destroyed, pursuant to this statute, certain buildings in the city, in which were the goods in controversy, without any thing farther. The objection taken was, that although the statute authorized the destruction of the building, it did not give license to destroy the goods ; or if it did, as it provided no compensation therefor, the statute so far was unconstitutional. Upon one or both of these points the court held the plea bad ; but it was never intimated by any member of the court that, so far as regards the blowing up of the building, the statute was unconstitutional and the act illegal, nor was it pretended, that if consequential loss or injury arose thereby, which could not have been foreseen or prevented, that defendant would be liable to an action therefor. The complaint was, that this plea destroyed the right of trial by jury on a question of necessity or no necessity, by making the judgment of the mayor and two aldermen conclusive on that point, even in .a case for the destruction of goods, the payment for which was not provided for by statute. That it took away the common law right of trying the question of necessity, and if found for the plaintiff, of obtaining pay for the goods in that way, while it provided no satisfaction in any other way. The counsel, in his argument before this court, says, 1 Zab. 719, “ The plea does not set up any act of imperative necessity, and then aver that the consequence was involuntary.” — “The evidence of necessity was the judgment of officers charged with the duty,” and the learned judge who delivered the opinion of this court says, 1 Zab. 735 — 6, “ The very effort and force required to destroy personal property which could be saved from conflagration by any possibility, would be sufficient to remove it, and save it from destruction ; but if it were beyond the possibility of escape or preservation, its destruction by the act of these officers could work no injury which would not otherwise have occurred, and in that case such a defence, if properly pleaded and proved, would avail them.” Again, “ I will not say, that if in the destruction of a building by gunpowder, some consequential injury or loss should result to the, personal property of another, which could not be foreseen or provided against by ordinary prudence, that these officers *612would have been liable to an action in their individual capacity for such loss or injury, or that they might not have pleaded this statute in bar of such action.” But the judge finds no warrant in the statute for the destruction of personal property by direct force and violence. Now it does seem to me that the plea now before us was drawn with great care and skill to meet the very difficulties and case suggested by counsel and court, and that it in fact does meet them all. In the dissenting opinion of the Supreme Court on the pleas now before us, which was given by the same judge who delivered the opinion of this court on the former plea, it is stated, as delivered on that occasion, “ that it (the New York law) was a constitutional law, so far as it extended to the destruction of buildings, providing compensation to the owners thereof.” The plea before us then sets out, by way of preamble, that by virtue of this constitutional law, he, being mayor of New York city, and Taylor and Benson aldermen, at the time of the fire, and they concurring, that, to prevent the further spread of conflagration and the destruction of property, the immediate destruction of the buildings wherein the goods in question were, was absolutely necessary, without waiting to remove the same, and that without such immediate destruction of said buildings, the fire could not have been arrested, but would have extended and destroyed a large part of the city. Wherefore for such cause the defendant did necessarily (doing as little damage or injury as-it was possible for him to do) blow up and destroy the said buildings, and, in so doing, did necessarily and unavoidably blow up and destroy the said goods. This plea is certainly very different from that formerly overruled by this court, for that, if good, was a complete bar to the action: it admitted of no answer and no issue to the country; it said nothing about the necessity fordoing the act; it entirely absorbed that question, and substituted the opinion of the mayor and aldermen for the verdict: of a jury; under that plea the plaintiff could by no possibility, under any aspect of his ease, obtain payment for his goods destroyed ; whereas the present plea merely places the defendant where the law and the constitution and the decision of this court placed him, that *613is, in the doing, as a public officer, of a lawful and constitutional act, viz. destroying a building to prevent the spread of a conflagration ; and then alleges, that being thus placed asa public officer, and required by law to act promptly, he was compelled from absolute necessity, in order to effect the object desired, to destroy this building before the goods could be removed therefrom. It thus tenders the issue of necessity to the plaintiff, and he may take issue thereon to the country and have a trial by jury; and if it appear that such necessity did not exist, he may recover the full value of the goods. This plea is, then, different both in form and substance from that overruled, and ought to be sustained. 1. It sets up the proceedings of a public officer in the lawful discharge of his duty, and if in doing this he has unintentionally and necessarily injured the plaintiff he is not answerable therefor. 4 T. R. 794: 2 Harr. 150; 1 Denio 595, Executors of Radcliff v. Mayor of Brooklyn, not yet reported, except in pamphlet form. This must be considered an unavoidable consequence springing from the direct lawful act of the defendant in blowing up the buildiug. The distinction which governs actions of trespass (for direct force) and on the case (for consequences) does not apply; for trespass alone, if any action, would lie for any injury whatever arising from the original cause: all injuries must be caused by the direct force and violence of the blowing up, and, according to the doctrine of the celebrated squib case, trespass, and not case, would lie. The true distinction is between the direct act intended, and done accordingly, viz. the destruction of the building, and the unintentional and unavoidable consequence growing out of that act, viz. the destruction of the goods: the first is justified by the statute according to the decision of this court, the second by the law of necessity, if the plea be true. Suppose, instead of an action for goods, this suit was for an assault and battery, would not this plea, if true, be a complete justification? Nay, if the defence set forth in this plea were offered in a case of homicide, with a trifling variation as to the position of the person, would this defence be overruled, and the defendant convicted for murder or manslaughter on the ground *614that the homicide, though unintentional, was committed in the performance of an unlawful act ? 2. This whole proceeding occurred in. another state, and arose under the statutes of that state; and in all the actions which have there been brought the conduct of the defendant has been sustained, the constitutionality of their law vindicated, and its application to the case in hand maintained. Trespass is a transitory action it is true, but why should this state be made the arena for judicial conflict? Are we to sit in judgment upon the decisions of the highest courts of the state of New Y ork, made upon the construction of their own statutes, and instead of adopting the invariable rule of the United States courts, which hold the decisions of state courts upon their own laws to be paramount, are we to say coolly to the judiciary of our sister states, you do not understand your own laws, your decisions are worthless, and we will overrule them, declare your law unconstitutional, and mulct in damages for their violation your citizens and officers ? If such should become the general course of decisions in this country, it would require no great skill to estimate the duration, or “ calculate the value of the Union.” After all the suits against the corporation had failed in regard to the goods which were destroyed by the blowing up of the buildings, these actions are brought against the defendant, individually, to compel him personally to pay the damages growing out of a lawful act,, which a statute of the state of New York required him to perform, and to do which his plea alleges it was “ absolutely necessary ” to destroy the goods, may he not plead and prove that ? Why, if there were no statute, any man could do that at common law. Does the statute or any principle prevent the defendant from doing so, and at the same time of availing himself of the position where the law'and his duty placed him? In this suit we only know the defendant, and if damages be recovered, they will be against him personally, and we know of no legal obligation in the city of New York to relieve him: this, it is true, would be of no consequence in a dear case against the defendant, but in a case like the present it is worthy of consideration. *6153. I think the destruction of the property in question does not come under the right of eminent domain, but under the right of necessity, of self-preservation. The right of eminent domain is a public right; it arises from the laws of society, and is vested in the state or its grantee, acting under the right and power of the state, and is the right to take or destroy private property for the use or benefit of the state, or of those acting under and for it. The right of necessity arises under the law .of nature; is older than the laws of society or society itself. It is the right of self-defence, of self-preservation, whether applied to persons or to property. It is a private right vested in every individual, and with which the rights of the state or state necessity has nothing to do. Of the right of eminent domain constitutions take cognizance, and say that “ private property shall not be taken without just compensation,” because it is a public right belonging to the state; but of the right of necessity, constitutions take no further notice than they do with any other private right, all being left under the regulation of the law and the legislature. A statute is passed to take the land or building or property of an individual for a fortification, a lighthouse, or a railroad : this comes under the right of eminent domain, and the constitution steps in and requires payment. A right of self-defence, of self-preservation, without regard to the lives or property of others, exists by necessity in every individual placed in certain situations at sea or on land, in the country or in a city; aud if the legislature think proper to pass a statute to regulate a portion of that right in a particular city, and instead of leaving its exercise to the blind action of all, make it the duty of certain officers to do the act, does this convert what was before a mere right of necessity in individuals into a public right of eminent domain? If it does, I am at an utter loss to understand the transmutation, and, notwithstanding opinions to the contrary, I do not believe that the statute of New York under consideration has any thing to do with the right of eminent domain, nor have I ascertained that in any particular it is unconstitutional. In conclusion, I am of opinion that, taking the decision of this court on the former occasion as our guide, the plea in *616question is good; and whether we consider that decision as in force or reversed, I also consider the plea good, and that it should be sustained.- 'For affirmance — Justices Randolph and Carpenter, and Judges Cornelison,Valentine,Wills, Risley, and Porter. For reversal — The Chancellor and Judge Schenck."
8,Angel v. McLellan (Mass. 1819) 236 n. 106,True,"As a general proposition, it will not be denied that the father is bound to support his children during the period of legal infancy. We contend that the proposition is not only generally, but universally true, if the parent is of sufficient ability. This principle, which is founded in the law of nature, has received the sanction of repeated judicial decisions; and the humanity of our municipal law is shown in extending its [ * 29 ] care of infants * somewhat further than is required by the law of nature. If an infant have a fortune, which comes aliunde, the law will not allow even the interest of this to be applied to the maintenance of the infant; not even though it be specifically ordered by the benefactor to be so applied, provided the father is of sufficient ability to maintain his child (1). The principles here stated are distinctly recognized as law by Parsons, C. J., in the cases of Whipple vs. Dow (2) and Dawes, J., vs. Howard (3). If the father neglect to fulfil this obligation, a third person, who furnishes necessaries to the infant, is deemed to have conferred an obligation on the delinquent parent, for which the law raises an implied promise on the part of the parent to pay (4). The general doctrine of the case last referred to is clearly recognized in the cases of Simpson vs. Robinson (5), and Crantz vs. Gill (6). These authorities afford an ample confirmation of the doctrine we support. It is for the defendant, then, to take this case out of the rule. Two exceptions are mentioned in the cases cited; one1 where the parent has supplied a fund for the support of an absent child, which is regularly applied to that use ; another where the necessaries sup*25plied were to an unreasonable amount. The defendant’s case falls within neither exception. But it is argued that the defendant ought not to be charged, because the son was profligate, had absconded, and was a fugitive from justice. If this is a bar to the plaintiff’s recovery, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove it clearly and explicitly. This was not done. All that is in proof is, that a warrant was issued to apprehend the son for a felony, and that the officer returned a non est inventus. This does not prove that he absconded from his father’s protection. He might have left the country before the warrant issued; or he might have left it with the knowledge and consent of his father. *But admitting the fact, it is no defence to the action, [ *30 ] which is founded on the obligation of the parent to support his child; and this obligation is not destroyed by an offence committed by the child against the community. There is not a dictum in the books authorizing such conclusion. - The other point, that the son was a spendthrift, is too vague to admit of the precision of legal reasoning. If the articles supplied were to minister to his prodigality, it would be an answer. But it was never supposed that, because the son was a prodigal, the father was thereby exempted from the obligation of supporting him with necessaries; and if so, this case is clearly within that of Van Valkinburgh vs. Watson. Whitman and Potter, for the defendant. (1) Com. Dig. Chancery, 3 R. 6, cites 1 Brown, 387. (2) 2 Mass. Rep. 415. (3) 4 Mass. Rep. 97. (4) 13 Johns. 480. Van Valkinburgh vs. Watson (5) 1 Esp. Rep. 17. (6) 2 Esp. Rep. 471. Parker, C. J. The circumstances of the plaintiff’s claim arc so favorable in an equitable point of view, and the grounds of defence, as they appear in the report of the trial, so rigid and illiberal, that, if regret was to be indulged in the performance of duty, we should certainly feel no small portion of it on the present occasion. We have indeed looked diligently for principles and authorities, upon which the plaintiff’s case might be sustained, but without success. There being no express promise, the question is, whether the facts proved raise an implied promise against the defendant. The defendant’s son had fallen into distress in a foreign country, to which he had fled to avoid the consequences of a crime committed in his native country. He was a minor and without property. The plaintiff, knowing his father to be a reputable merchant, paid his board, and supplied him with such things as were necessary for his condition, relying upon the honor and gratitude of the father to reimburse him. The liability of the father must depend altogether upon the principles of law, which govern the relation of parent and child. The father is obliged to support his children, while they remain part of his family. • * Perhaps if he fail to fur- [ * 31 ] *26nish them with clothing and food necessary to the support of life, any one who furnishes such necessaries may maintain an action against the father, upon the presumption of an assent on his part. Perhaps, also, if he cruelly and causelessly turn them out of doors, they would carry with them a credit on the father for the means of support; although it may be questioned whether, in such a case, the support of such children should not be provided for pursuant to the statute, requiring the kindred of poor persons within certain degrees to support them (7). But upon these points, the case before us does not require an opinion. However this may be, we think it clear that, when a child leaves his parent’s house voluntarily, for the purpose of seeking his fortune in the world, or to avoid the discipline and restraint so necessary for the due regulation of families, he carries with him no credit; and the parent is under no obligation to pay for his support. The case is still stronger against such a claim, when the child, having arrived at years of discretion, but not of manhood, shall have violated the laws and become a fugitive from justice. For necessaries a minor under such circumstances, in countries where the common law prevails, and probably in all civilized countries, is personally liable; and when his personal liability begins, it should seem that the liability of his parents would cease. An infant, when at home under the care of his father, and supported by him, is not liable even for necessaries. If he were, the father would be deprived of the right of exercising his discretion, as to the manner and degree of his support (8). It would seem a just inference from the principles of the decision referred to, that, when the authority of the parent is abjured, without any necessity occasioned by the parent, all obligation to provide for him has ceased, and that those who choose to supply him, do it at the peril of the child’s ability, or the parent’s willingness to indemnify them.. [ * 32 ] * There are undoubtedly some cases, in which the application of this doctrine may appear, harsh ; but an attention to the consequences of a different doctrine will be a sufficient vindication of the principle. Could a refractory or vicious son leave his father’s house, without being exposed to want, carrying with him a credit on his father wherever he might wander, the motive for submitting to authority might be materially impaired, and a great diminution of parental influence might ensue. One of the greatest restraints upon the bad passions and vicious propensities would i.e removed, if young persons should feel that they could flee their parents’ presence, without suffering in any of the essentials of life. The law, therefore, has wisely left individual cases of generous *27interference, to depend upon the honor of those connected with the object of it, rather than place in the hands of thoughtless or ill-disposed youth their parent’s purse, to supply their wants with, whenever they should incline to deny his authority, and withdraw themselves from his government. In the argument for the plaintiff, we see many reasons to regret that he has been obliged to resort to a suit for money, which he had a right to expect would have been returned to him, with gratitude for his well-intended advances. But the law cannot be bent to his case; and we are persuaded, that public policy, and a due regard to parental authority, will sufficiently justify the law (9). New trial granted. Note.

9,"Antelope, The (U.S. 1825) 230 n. 28",False,"23 U.S. 66 (____) 10 Wheat. 66 The ANTELOPE. The Vice-Consuls of Spain and Portugal, Libellants. Supreme Court of United States. *69 The Attorney General, for the appellants. Mr. Key, for the appellants. Mr. Berrien, for the respondents. *114 Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court, and, after stating the case, proceeded as follows: In prosecuting this appeal, the United States assert no property in themselves. They appear in the character of guardians, or next friends, of these Africans, who are brought, without any act of their own, into the bosom of our country, insist on their right to freedom, and submit their claim to the laws of the land, and to the tribunals of the nation. The Consuls of Spain and Portugal, respectively, demand these Africans as slaves, who have, in the regular course of legitimate commerce, been acquired as property by the subjects of their respective sovereigns, and claim their restitution under the laws of the United States. In examining claims of this momentous importance; claims in which the sacred rights of liberty and of property come in conflict with each other; which have drawn from the bar a degree of talent and of eloquence, worthy of the questions that have been discussed; this Court must not yield to feelings which might seduce it from the path of duty, and must obey the mandate of the law. That the course of opinion on the slave trade should be unsettled, ought to excite no surprise. The Christian and civilized nations of the world. *115 with whom we have most intercourse, have all been engaged in it. However abhorrent this traffic may be to a mind whose original feelings are not blunted by familiarity with the practice, it has been sanctioned in modern times by the laws of all nations who possess distant colonies, each of whom has engaged in it as a common commercial business which no other could rightfully interrupt. It has claimed all the sanction which could be derived from long usage, and general acquiescence. That trade could not be considered as contrary to the law of nations which was authorized and protected by the laws of all commercial nations; the right to carry on which was claimed by each, and allowed by each. The course of unexamined opinion, which was founded on this inveterate usage, received its first check in America; and, as soon as these States acquired the right of self-government, the traffic was forbidden by most of them. In the beginning of this century, several humane and enlightened individuals of Great Britain devoted themselves to the cause of the Africans; and, by frequent appeals to the nation, in which the enormity of this commerce was unveiled, and exposed to the public eye, the general sentiment was at length roused against it, and the feelings of justice and humanity, regaining their long lost ascendency, prevailed so far in the British parliament as to obtain an act for its abolition. The utmost efforts of the British government, as well as of that of the United States, have since been assiduously *116 employed in its suppression. It has been denounced by both in terms of great severity, and those concerned in it are subjected to the heaviest penalties which law can inflict. In addition to these measures operating on their own people, they have used all their influence to bring other nations into the same system, and to interdict this trade by the consent of all. Public sentiment has, in both countries, kept pace with the measures of government; and the opinion is extensively, if not universally entertained, that this unnatural traffic ought to be suppressed. While its illegality is asserted by some governments, but not admitted by all; while the detestation in which it is held is growing daily, and even those nations who tolerate it in fact, almost disavow their own conduct, and rather connive at, than legalize, the acts of their subjects; it is not wonderful that public feeling should march somewhat in advance of strict law, and that opposite opinions should be entertained on the precise cases in which our own laws may control and limit the practice of others. Indeed, we ought not to be surprised, if, on this novel series of cases, even Courts of justice should, in some instances, have carried the principle of suppression farther than a more deliberate consideration of the subject would justify. The Amedie, (1 Acton's Rep. 240.) which was an American vessel employed in the African trade, was captured by a British cruiser, and condemned in the Vice Admiralty Court of Tortola. *117 An appeal was prayed; and Sir William Grant, in delivering the opinion of the Court, said, that the trade being then declared unjust and unlawful by Great Britain, ""a claimant could have no right, upon principles of universal law, to claim restitution in a prize Court, of human beings carried as his slaves. He must show some right that has been violated by the capture, some property of which he has been dispossessed, and to which he ought to be restored. In this case, the laws of the claimant's country allow of no right of property such as he claims. There can, therefore, be no right of restitution. The consequence is, that the judgment must be affirmed."" The Fortuna (1 Dodson's Rep. 81.) was condemned on the authority of the Amedie, and the same principle was again affirmed. The Diana (1 Dodson's Rep. 95.) was a Swedish vessel, captured with a cargo of slaves, by a British cruiser, and condemned in the Court of Vice Admiralty at Sierra Leone. This sentence was reversed on appeal, and Sir William Scott, in pronouncing the sentence of reversal, said, ""the condemnation also took place on a principle which this Court cannot in any manner recognise, inasmuch as the sentence affirms, `that the slave trade, from motives of humanity, hath been abolished by most civilized nations, and is not, at the present time, legally authorized by any.' This appears to me to be an assertion by no means sustainable."" The ship and cargo were restored, on the principle that the trade was allowed by the laws of Sweden. *118 The principle common to these cases is, that the legality of the capture of a vessel engaged in the slave trade, depends on the law of the country to which the vessel belongs. If that law gives its sanction to the trade, restitution will be decreed; if that law prohibits it, the vessel and cargo will be condemned as good prize. This whole subject came on afterwards to be considered in the Louis, (2 Dodson's Rep. 238.) The opinion of Sir William Scott, in that case, demonstrates the attention he had bestowed upon it, and gives full assurance that it may be considered as settling the law in the British Courts of Admiralty as far as it goes. The Louis was a French vessel, captured on a slaving voyage, before she had purchased any slaves, brought into Sierra Leone, and condemned by the Vice Admiralty Court at that place. On an appeal to the Court of Admiralty in England, the sentence was reversed. In the very full and elaborate opinion given on this case, Sir William Scott, in explicit terms, lays down the broad principle, that the right of search is confined to a state of war. It is a right strictly belligerent in its character, which can never be exercised by a nation at peace, except against professed pirates, who are the enemies of the human race. The act of trading in slaves, however detestable, was not, he said, ""the act of freebooters, enemies of the human race, renouncing every country, and ravaging every country, in its coasts and vessels, indiscriminately."" It was not piracv. *119 He also said, that this trade could not be pronounced contrary to the law of nations. ""A Court, in the administration of law, cannot attribute criminality to an act where the law imputes none. It must look to the legal standard of morality; and, upon a question of this nature, that standard must be found in the law of nations, as fixed and evidenced by general, and ancient, and admitted practice, by treaties, and by the general tenor of the laws and ordinances, and the formal transactions of civilized states; and, looking to those authorities, he found a difficulty in maintaining that the transaction was legally criminal."" The right of visitation and search being strictly a belligerent right, and the slave trade being neither piratical, nor contrary to the law of nations, the principle is asserted and maintained with great strength of reasoning, that it cannot be exercised on the vessels of a foreign power, unless permitted by treaty. France had refused to assent to the insertion of such an article in her treaty with Great Britain and, consequently, the right could not be exercised on the high seas by a British cruiser on a French vessel. ""It is pressed as a difficulty,"" says the Judge, ""what is to be done, if a French ship, laden with slaves, is brought in? I answer, without hesitation, restore the possession which has been unlawfully devested; rescind the illegal act done by your own subject, and leave the foreigner to the justice of his own country."" This reasoning goes far in support of the proposition, *120 that, in the British Courts of admiralty, the vessel even of a nation which had forbidden the slave trade, but had not conceded the right of search, must, if wrongfully brought in, be restored to the original owner. But the Judge goes farther, and shows, that no evidence existed to prove that France had, by law, forbidden that trade. Consequently, for this reason, as well as for that previously assigned, the sentence of condemnation was reversed, and restitution awarded. In the United States, different opinions have been entertained in the different Circuits and Districts; and the subject is now, for the first time, before this Court. The question, whether the slave trade is prohibited by the law of nations has been seriously propounded, and both the affirmative and negative of the proposition have been maintained with equal earnestness. That it is contrary to the law of nature will scarcely be denied. That every man has a natural right to the fruits of his own labour, is generally admitted; and that no other person can rightfully deprive him of those fruits, and appropriate them against his will, seems to be the necessary result of this admission. But from the earliest times war has existed, and war confers rights in which all have acquiesced. Among the most enlightened nations of antiquity, one of these was, that the victor might enslave the vanquished. This, which was the usage of all, could not be pronounced repugnant to the law of nations, which is certainly to be tried by the test of *121 neral usage. That which has received the assent of all, must be the law of all. Slavery, then, has its origin in force; but as the world has agreed that it is a legitimate result of force, the state of things which is thus produced by general consent, cannot be pronounced unlawful. Throughout Christendom, this harsh rule has been exploded, and war is no longer considered as giving a right to enslave captives. But this triumph of humanity has not been universal. The parties to the modern law of nations do not propagate their principles by force; and Africa has not yet adopted them. Throughout the whole extent of that immense continent, so far as we know its history, it is still the law of nations that prisoners are slaves. Can those who have themselves renounced this law, be permitted to participate in its effects by purchasing the beings who are its victims? Whatever might be the answer of a moralist to this question, a jurist must search for its legal solution, in those principles of action which are sanctioned by the usages, the national acts, and the general assent, of that portion of the world of which he considers himself as a part, and to whose law the appeal is made. If we resort to this standard as the test of international law, the question, as has already been observed, is decided in favor of the legality of the trade. Both Europe and America embarked in it; and for nearly two centuries, it was carried on without opposition, and without censure. A jurist could *122 not say, that a practice thus supported was illegal, and that those engaged in it might be punished, either personally, or by deprivation of property. In this commerce, thus sanctioned by universal assent, every nation had an equal right to engage. How is this right to be lost? Each may renounce it for its own people; but can this renunciation affect others? No principle of general law is more universally acknowledged, than the perfect equality of nations. Russia and Geneva have equal rights. It results from this equality, that no one can rightfully impose a rule on another. Each legislates for itself, but its legislation can operate on itself alone. A right, then, which is vested in all by the consent of all, can be devested only by consent; and this trade, in which all have participated, must remain lawful to those who cannot be induced to relinquish it. As no nation can prescribe a rule for others, none can make a law of nations; and this traffic remains lawful to those whose governments have not forbidden it. If it is consistent with the law of nations, it cannot in itself be piracy. It can be made so only by statute; and the obligation of the statute cannot transcend the legislative power of the state which may enact it. If it be neither repugnant to the law of nations, nor piracy, it is almost superfluous to say in this Court, that the right of bringing in for adjudication in time of peace, even where the vessel belongs to a nation which has prohibited the trade, *123 cannot exist. The Courts of no country execute the penal laws of another; and the course of the American government on the subject of visitation and search, would decide any case in which that right had been exercised by an American cruiser, on the vessel of a foreign nation, not violating our municipal laws, against the captors. It follows, that a foreign vessel engaged in the African slave trade, captured on the high-seas in time of peace, by an American cruiser, and brought in for adjudication, would be restored. The general question being disposed of, it remains to examine the circumstances of the particular case. The Antelope, a vessel unquestionably belonging to Spanish subjects, was captured while receiving a cargo of Africans on the coast of Africa, by the Arraganta, a privateer which was manned in Baltimore, and is said to have been then under the flag of the Oriental republic. Some other vessels, said to be Portuguese, engaged in the same traffic, were previously plundered, and the slaves taken from them, as well as from another vessel then in the same port, were put on board the Antelope, of which vessel the Arraganta took possession, landed her crew, and put on board a prize master and prize crew. Both vessels proceeded to the coast of Brazil, where the Arraganta was wrecked, and her captain and crew either lost or made prisoners. The Antelope, whose name was changed to the General Ramirez, after an ineffectual attempt *124 to sell the Africans on board at Surinam, arrived off the coast of Florida, and was hovering on that coast, near that of the United States, for several days. Supposing her to be a pirate, or a vessel wishing to smuggle slaves into the United States, Captain Jackson, of the revenue cutter Dallas, went in quest of her, and finding her laden with slaves, commanded by officers who were citizens of the United States, with a crew who spoke English, brought her in for adjudication. She was libelled by the Vice Consuls of Spain and Portugal, each of whom claim that portion of the slaves which were conjectured to belong to the subjects of their respective sovereigns; which claims are opposed by the United States on behalf of the Africans. In the argument, the question on whom the onus probandi is imposed, has been considered as of great importance, and the testimony adduced by the parties has been critically examined. It is contended, that the Antelope, having been wrongfully dispossessed of her slaves by American citizens, and being now, together with her cargo, in the power of the United States, ought to be restored, without farther inquiry, to those out of whose possession she was thus wrongfully taken. No proof of property, it is said, ought to be required. Possession is in such a case evidence of property. Conceding this as a general proposition, the counsel for the United States deny its application to this case. A distinction is taken between *125 men, who are generally free, and goods, which are always property. Although, with respect to the last, possession may constitute the only proof of property which is demandable, something more is necessary where men are claimed. Some proof should be exhibited that the possession was legally acquired. A distinction has been also drawn between Africans unlawfully taken from the subjects of a foreign power by persons acting under the authority of the United States, and Africans first captured by a belligerent privateer, or by a pirate, and then brought rightfully into the United States, under a reasonable apprehension that a violation of their laws was intended. Being rightfully in the possession of an American Court, that Court, it is contended, must be governed by the laws of its own country; and the condition of these Africans must depend on the laws of the United States, not on the laws of Spain and Portugal. Had the Arraganta been a regularly commissioned cruiser, which had committed no infraction of the neutrality of the United States, her capture of the Antelope must have been considered as lawful, and no question could have arisen respecting the rights of the original claimants. The question of prize or no prize belongs solely to the Courts of the captor. But, having violated the neutrality of the United States, and having entered our ports, not voluntarily, but under coercion, some difficulty exists respecting the extent of the obligation to restore, on the mere *126 proof of former possession, which is imposed on this government. If, as is charged in the libels of both the Consuls, as well as of the United States, she was a pirate, hovering on the coast with intent to introduce slaves in violation of the laws of the United States, our treaty requires that property rescued from pirates shall be restored to the Spanish owner on his making proof of his property. Whether the General Ramirez, originally the Antelope, is to be considered as the prize of a commissioned belligerent ship of war unlawfully equipped in the United States, or as a pirate, it seems proper to make some inquiry into the title of the claimants. In support of the Spanish claim, testimony is produced, showing the documents under which the Antelope sailed from the Havana on the voyage on which she was captured; that she was owned by a Spanish house of trade in that place; that she was employed in the business of purchasing slaves, and had purchased and taken on board a considerable number, when she was seized as prize by the Arraganta. Whether, on this proof, Africans brought into the United States, under the various circumstances belonging to this case, ought to be restored or not, is a question on which much difficulty has been felt. It is unnecessary to state the reasons in support of the affirmative or negative answer to it, because the Court is divided on it, and, consequently, no principle is settled. So much of the decree of the Circuit Court as directs *127 restitution to the Spanish claimant of the Africans found on board the Antelope when she was captured by the Arraganta, is affirmed. There is some difficulty in ascertaining their number. The libel claims one hundred and fifty as belonging to Spanish subjects, and charges that one hundred or more of these were on board the Antelope. Grondona and Ximenes, Spanish officers of the Antelope before her capture, both depose positively to the number of one hundred and sixty-six. Some deduction, however, is to be made from the weight of Grondona's testimony, because, he says, in one of his depositions, that he did not count the slaves on the last day when some were brought on board, and adds, that he had lost his papers, and spoke from memory, and from the information he had received from others of the crew, after his arrival in the Havana. Such of the crew as were examined, concur with Grondona and Ximenes as to numbers. The depositions of the Spanish witnesses on this point, are opposed by those of John Smith, the Captain of the General Ramirez, and William Brunton, one of the crew of the Arraganta, who was transferred to the Antelope. John Smith deposes, that ninety-three Africans were found on board the Antelope when captured, which he believes to have been Spanish property. He also says, that one hundred and eighty-three were taken out of Portuguese vessels. William Brunton deposes, that more slaves *128 were taken out of the Portuguese ship than were in any other, and that ninety odd were represented by the crew to have been on board the Antelope when she was captured. If, to the positive testimony of these witnesses, we add the inference to be drawn from the statement of the libel, and the improbability that so large a number of Africans as are claimed could have been procured, under the circumstances in which the Antelope was placed, between the 13th, when she was liberated by the first pirate who seized her, and the 23d, when she was finally captured, we are rather disposed to think the weight of testimony is in favor of the smaller number. But supposing perfect equality in this respect, the decision ought, we think, to be against the claimant. Whatever doubts may attend the question whether the Spanish claimants are entitled to restitution of all the Africans taken out of their possession with the Antelope, we cannot doubt the propriety of demanding ample proof of the extent of that possession. Every legal principle which requires the plaintiff to prove his claim in any case, applies with full force to this point; and no countervailing consideration exists. The onus probandi, as to the number of Africans which were on board when the vessel was captured, unquestionably lies on the Spanish libellants. Their proof is not satisfactory beyond ninety-three. The individuals who compose this number must be designated to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court. *129 We proceed next to consider the libel of the Vice-Consul of Portugal. It claims one hundred and thirty slaves, or more, ""all of whom, as the libellant is informed and believes,"" are the property of a subject or subjects of his Most Faithful Majesty; and although ""the rightful owners of such slaves be not at this time individually and certainly known to the libellant, he hopes and expects soon to discover them."" John Smith, and William Brunton, whose depositions have already been noticed, both state, that several Africans were taken out of Portuguese vessels; but neither of them state the means by which they ascertained the national character of the vessels they had plundered. It does not appear that their opinions were founded on any other fact than the flag under which the vessels sailed. Grondona, also, states the plunder of a Portuguese vessel, lying in the same port, and engaged in the same traffic with the Antelope when she was captured; but his testimony is entirely destitute of all those circumstances which would enable us to say, that he had any knowledge of the real character of the vessel, other than was derived from her flag. The cause furnishes no testimony of any description, other than these general declarations, that the proprietors of the Africans now claimed by the Vice-Consul of Portugal, were the subjects of his king; nor is there any allusion to the individuals to whom they belong. These vessels were plundered in March, 1820, and the libel was filed in August of the same year. From *130 that time to this, a period of more than five years, no subject of the crown of Portugal has appeared to assert his title to this property, no individual has been designated as its probable owner. This inattention to a subject of so much real interest, this total disregard of a valuable property, is so contrary to the common course of human action, as to justify serious suspicion that the real owner dares not avow himself. That Americans, and others, who cannot use the flag of their own nation, carry on this criminal and inhuman traffic under the flags of other countries, is a fact of such general notoriety, that Courts of admiralty may act upon it. It cannot be necessary to take particular depositions, to prove a fact which is matter of general and public history. This long, and otherwise unaccountable absence, of any Portuguese claimant, furnishes irresistible testimony, that no such claimant exists, and that the real owner belongs to some other nation, and feels the necessity of concealment. An attempt has been made to supply this defect of testimony, by adducing a letter from the secretary to whose department the foreign relations of Portugal are supposed to be intrusted, suggesting the means of transporting to Portugal those slaves which may be in the possession of the Vice-Consul, as the property of his fellow subjects. Allow to this document all the effect which can be claimed for it, and it can do no more than supply the want of an express power *131 from the owners of the slaves to receive them. It cannot be considered as ascertaining the owners, or as proving their property. The difficulty, then, is not diminished by this paper. These Africans still remain unclaimed by the owner, or by any person professing to know the owner. They are rightfully taken from American citizens, and placed in possession of the law. No property whatever in them is shown. It is said, that possession, in a case of this description, is equivalent to property. Could this be conceded, who had the possession? From whom were they taken by the Arraganta? It is not alleged that they are the property of the crown, but of some individual. Who is that individual? No such person is shown to exist, and his existence, after such a lapse of time, cannot be presumed. The libel, which claims them for persons entirely unknown, alleges a state of things which is prima facie evidence of an intent to violate the laws of the United States, by the commission of an act which, according to those laws, entitles these men to freedom. Nothing whatever can interpose to arrest the course of the law, but the title of the real proprietor. No such title appears, and every presumption is against its existence. We think, then, that all the Africans, now in possession of the Marshal for the District of Georgia, and under the control of the Circuit Court of the United States for that District, which were brought in with the Antelope, otherwise *132 called the General Ramirez, except those which may be designated as the property of the Spanish claimants, ought to be delivered up to the United States, to be disposed of according to law. So much of the sentence of the Circuit Court as is contrary to this opinion, is to be reversed, and the residue affirmed. DECREE. This cause came on to be heard, &c.; On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that there is error in so much of the sentence and decree of the said Circuit Court, as directs the restitution to the Spanish claimant of the Africans in the proceedings mentioned, in the ratio which one hundred and sixty-six bears to the whole number of those which remained alive at the time of pronouncing the said decree; and also in so much thereof, as directs restitution to the Portuguese claimant; and that so much of the said decree ought to be reversed, and it is hereby reversed and annulled. And this Court, proceeding to give such decree as the said Circuit Court ought to have given, doth DIRECT and ORDER, that the restitution to be made to the Spanish claimant, shall be according to the ratio which ninety-three (instead of one hundred and sixty-six) bears to the whole number, comprehending as well those originally on board the Antelope, as those which were put on board that vessel by the Captain of the Arraganta. After making the apportionment according to this ratio, and deducting from the number the rateable loss which must fall on the slaves to which the Spanish claimants were originally entitled, the *133 residue of the said ninety-three are to be delivered to the Spanish claimant, on the terms in the said decree mentioned; and all the remaining Africans are to be delivered to the United States, to be disposed of according to law; and the said decree of the said Circuit Court is, in all things not contrary to this decree, affirmed."
10,Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Van Ness (Fed. D.C. 1835) 233 n. 65,False,"57 Ct.Clms. 140 affirmed. Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition, after a hearing upon the merits, in an action to recover compensation under the Dent Act. MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court. The Railway Company filed its petition, under the Dent Act (March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272), to recover compensation for constructing temporary barracks for the use of United States troops under an ""implied agreement"" alleged to have been entered into by it with the United States in December, 1917, through Col. Kimball, Expeditionary Quartermaster of the War Department at Locust Point, Baltimore, Maryland, acting under the authority of the Secretary of War. The Court of Claims, after a hearing on the merits and upon its findings of fact, dismissed the petition. 57 Ct.Cls. 140. The material facts shown by the findings are these: the railroad company owned at Locust Point, a suburb of Baltimore, eight piers, which were guarded by its civilian employees. At the request of Col. Kimball, who was Page 261 U. S. 594 in charge of the expeditionary depot at Baltimore and of the supplies arriving for shipment to Europe, the company, in October, 1917, leased one of these piers to the government. Two of the other piers with much other property belonging to the company were destroyed or damaged by a fire supposed to be of incendiary origin. Thereupon, Col. Kimball and the president of the company separately requested the Secretary of War to send a guard; the vice-president of the company offering to supply a wrecking train as quarters for them. Two companies of the National Guard were sent to Locust Point, with sufficient tentage. They were quartered for a time in the wrecking train furnished by the company. Their duty was primarily to protect the government property and the piers leased by it, sending patrols throughout the railroad yard to guard cars containing its property, and generally to guard all the piers and property at Locust Point. The company, however, also maintained the civilian guards and a fire department for all of its property, whether leased or not. Later, the wrecking train having been moved away by the company, the troops moved into tents. The weather during the fall and winter was very cold and inclement. Most of the soldiers were Baltimoreans, and were frequently visited by their relatives. There was some sickness among them. Their relatives complained to the railroad officials of hardships they had to undergo in the tents, and these officials were anxious to make them as comfortable as possible. Several times in very cold weather, Col. Kimball remarked to the company's agent at Locust Point, whose duty it was to confer with him on railroad matters, that the troops ought to have better quarters. On one occasion, this agent suggested fitting up an unused transfer shed belonging to the company, standing near the pier that had been leased to the government. Col. Kimball agreed that it would be a fine thing to make the men as comfortable Page 261 U. S. 595 as possible. He did not, however, ask that this work be done, and nothing was said about compensation. This agent having taken up with the company's officials the matter of fitting up the transfer shed, its chief engineering draftsman was directed to see as to the adaptability of the transfer shed for barracks. He made blueprint plans for remodeling the shed which he showed to the officer in command of the troops to learn whether, in his opinion, they would satisfactorily house the troops. This officer, while not undertaking to approve the plans, suggested the amount of facilities that would be required. Nothing was said to him, however, about expense or compensation for the work. The construction of the temporary barracks was completed in the latter part of December, and the troops moved in. Two more piers were afterwards leased by the company to the government. The barracks were occupied by the troops until May, 1919, and the piers were returned to the company in June, 1919. No government officials connected with the work at Locust Point had any authority to order the construction of the temporary barracks, and no orders were given by any of them for such construction. The subject of compensation was not mentioned in any conversations between these officers and the railroad officials until more than a week after the barracks had been completed, when the chief draftsman told the officer in command of the troops that he thought the government should reimburse him for some of his trouble. The Court of Claims made no finding as to the amount expended by the company in constructing the temporary barracks, the company having, as the court stated, submitted no evidence to establish the different items of its claim. In the absence of a finding as to the amount of the expenditures, as to which the company had the burden of proof, the judgment of the Court of Claims might be properly affirmed upon that ground. Crocker v. United Page 261 U. S. 596 States, 240 U. S. 74, 240 U. S. 82. However, as the government does not here question the amount of the claim, we pass to its further consideration upon the merits. Upon the findings of fact, we conclude that the petition was rightly dismissed, without reference to the amount of the claim, for two reasons: 1. The Dent Act authorizes the award of compensation for expenditures connected with the prosecution of the war when they were made by the claimant upon the faith of an ""agreement, express or implied,"" entered into by him with an officer or agent acting under the authority of the Secretary of War or of the President and such agreement was not executed in the manner provided by law. 40 Stat. 1272, 1273; American Smelting Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 75, 259 U. S. 79. The act was intended to remedy irregularities and informalities in the mode of entering into such agreements, not to enlarge the authority of the agents by whom they were made. To entitle the claimant to compensation under such an agreement, it is essential that the officer or agent with whom it was entered into should not merely have been holding under the Secretary of War or the President, but that he should have been acting within the scope of his authority. It was not intended, for example, that an officer in one branch of the military service or one of inferior rank could bind the government by an agreement as to matters relating to an entirely different branch of the service or within the control of his superior officers as to which he had no authority whatever, or that an agreement into which he entered, although beyond his authority, should become binding upon the government because it was made in the form of an express agreement not executed within the legal manner or of an implied agreement merely -- that is, that his authority should be enlarged by the irregularity or informality with which it was exercised. See United States v. North American Transportation Page 261 U. S. 597 & Trading Co., 253 U. S. 330, 253 U. S. 333, and Portsmouth Harbor Land Co. v. United States, 260 U. S. 327. Here, however, there is no finding that Col. Kimball had any authority to enter into the alleged agreement, and, on the contrary, such authority is negatived by the finding that none of the government officials connected with the work at Locust Point had any authority to order the construction of a temporary barracks. Hence, an essential element in the establishment of the company's claim is lacking. 2. The ""implied agreement"" contemplated by the Dent Act as the basis of compensation is not an agreement ""implied in law,"" more aptly termed a constructive or quasi contract where, by fiction of law, a promise is imputed to perform a legal duty, as to repay money obtained by fraud or duress, but an agreement ""implied in fact"" founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding. See, by analogy, as to the construction of similar jurisdictional statutes, United States v. Berdan Firearms Co., 156 U. S. 552, 156 U. S. 566; Russell v. United States, 182 U. S. 516, 182 U. S. 530; Harley v. United States, 198 U. S. 229, 198 U. S. 234; United States v. Anciens Etablissements, 224 U. S. 309, 224 U. S. 311, 224 U. S. 320; United States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., 234 U. S. 228, 234 U. S. 232; Tempel v. United States, 248 U. S. 121, 248 U. S. 129, and Sutton v. United States, 256 U. S. 575, 256 U. S. 581; and, generally, Railway Co. v. Gaffney, 65 Ohio St. 104, 113; Woods v. Ayres, 39 Mich. 345, 350; Hertzog v. Hertzog, 29 Pa. 465, 468; Knapp v. United States, 46 Ct.Cls. 601, 643, and 1 Bouv.Law Dict. (Rawle's 3d Rev.) 660. That this provision of the Dent Act relates only to such actual agreements, implied in fact from the circumstances, is not only indicated by its purpose, as expressed in the caption, of providing relief in cases of ""contracts"" connected Page 261 U. S. 598 with the prosecution of the war, but is conclusively shown by the fact that the ""agreement"" is described as one ""entered into, in good faith,"" by the claimant, with an officer or agent of the government, upon the faith of which expenditures have been made or obligations incurred, and which has not been executed as prescribed by law; this language aptly describing an actual agreement implied in fact, but being manifestly inapplicable to a constructive agreement implied in law. Such an agreement will not be implied unless the meeting of minds was indicated by some intelligible conduct, act, or sign. Woods v. Ayres, 39 Mich. 351, and cases there cited. And so an agreement to pay for services rendered by the plaintiff will not be implied when they were rendered spontaneously, without request, as an act of kindness (Woods v. Ayres, 39 Mich. 351); when the plaintiff did not expect payment, or under the circumstances did not have reason to entertain such expectation (Coleman v. United States, 152 U. S. 96, 152 U. S. 99; Lafontain v. Hayhurst, 89 Me. 388, 391); when the defendant understood that the plaintiff would neither expect nor demand remuneration (Harley v. United States, 198 U. S. 235); when unusual expenses were incurred without special request or previous notice and without any intimation or suggestion that compensation would be looked for or made (Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. United States, ante, 261 U. S. 385); when the defendant neither requested the services nor assented to receiving their benefit under circumstances negativing any presumption that they would be gratuitous (Railway Co. v. Gaffney, supra, p. 116; 2 Abb.Tr.Ev., 3d ed., 912, and cases there cited); [Footnote 1] and Page 261 U. S. 599 when the circumstances account for the transaction on a ground more probable than that of a promise of recompense (Wood v. Ayres, supra, p. 351.) [Footnote 2] In the present case, the findings of fact show that Col. Kimball did not order the construction of the barracks, which was voluntarily undertaken by the company, without saying anything whatever about compensation, apparently from its own desire to provide for the comfort of the troops, who were guarding its property as well as that of the government, after it had removed the wrecking train which it had offered to supply as their quarters. It does not appear from the findings that Col. Kimball requested the construction of the barracks, that the company intimated that it would expect payment from the government, or that Col. Kimball suggested that such payment would be made, or that the company in fact expected compensation. It is clear that these findings furnish no substantial basis for implying an agreement that the government would pay the cost of the construction. Hence, a second essential element in the establishment of the company's claim is lacking. And the judgment of the Court of Claims is Affirmed. [Footnote 1] But an agreement to compensate the plaintiff for the use of his property will be implied when it was used by the defendant without claim of right, and the plaintiff consented to such use with the expectation of receiving compensation. United States v. Palmer, 128 U. S. 262, 128 U. S. 269; United States v. Berdan Firearms Co., 156 U. S. 552, 156 U. S. 567; United States v. Anciens Etablissements, 224 U. S. 320.

S. 330, and cases there cited. [Footnote 2] As to the character of evidence by which an implied agreement to pay for services is generally established, see 2 Abb. Tr. Ev. 913, and cases there cited."

That makes no difference. The decision is in point *, and, till reversed, we must abide by it.] [Sutherland, J. There is but one way of questioning our opinions upon a point directly involved in the cause decided. That is by bringing a writ of error. If we sit to hear them questioned in this Court, there is nothing settled by any decision which we can make. On a point incidentally decided, it might be different.] *737 Spencer. It was necessary to raise the point here in order to avail ourselves of.it upon error, should the Court be against us. ■ . ' [Savage, Ch. J. You are undoubtedly right in raising the question, but a majority of the Court are decidedly against hearing it argued.] Spencer proceeded to the 5th point. 5. This relates to the question of intention, and the force of usage. If one, on loaning money, take more than 7 per cent, at the time of the loan, the law will fix the intent. The bank clerk says, that Hunt, the cashier, ordered him to discontinue the calendar year, and calculate by the rule adopted in relation to these notes; and that he had done so ever since he came into the institution. Was either the cashier or the clerk ignorant of the consequences which would follow ? The almanac is a part of the law of the land,(u) and every one will be presumed to understand it. If the conventional standard take more than 7 per cent, the law will imply intention and corruption. A loan is for a year’s per cent, or more, or less. The parts of a year are in question. The statute does not mention months, or any term short of a year. It speaks of a loan for a year, or, a longer or shorter time, The necessity of resorting to months, upon principles of convenience is denied. The legislature knew that interest could be computed by years and days with perfect ease. Why then resort to months 1 The answer given by the plaintiffs is, that they have been guilty of taking, interest in this manner for more than 10 years, and that their neighbors are as guilty as they are. In Marsh v. Martindale, Ld. Alvanley, Ch. J. gave his opinion, in terms, “ that if a man agree to take more than 5 per cent, for the forbearance of money, the law declares that such an agreement is corrupt, within the statute of Anne, whether the party thought, at the time, that he was acting contrary to the statute or not.” That case was a bill of exchange for £5000, for which a bond was substituted, payable at 3 years, and £750, the precise legal interest, was *738taken in advance. All the points decided were material to the present case. The first was, that taking interest in advance is usury: 2. That taking more than legal interest on a loan, in any case, is usury: and 3. That this is a question of law. “ And though (says the Ch. Justice) the jury have found that Sir Charles Marsh did not think that he was acting contrary to law, there is nothing in that finding to prevent us from examining the transaction, and declaring it to be corrupt, if it appear to us to be so in point of law without sending the case back to a jury to find the corruption.” The custom relied on must be very limited. The Court will see, by an examination of our bank charters, that they are rarely authorized to take more than 6 per cent, interest. This usage could not have existed any where in the state, till this bank was chartered, 13 or 14 years ago. The usage of shortening months, &c., must have been confined, before this to discounts at 6 per cent, which would not have reached the sum allowed by the statute of usury. There is, then, no usage to influence the case. But if there were usage, I deny its force when set up to control the statute of usury. I do this on the authority of Dunham v. Gould, (v) decided by the Court of Errors, in which the late Chancellor examines all the cases upon this point, and shows that they rest upon distinct principles. Suppose a loan of $1000, at 3 years; and 3 separate notes, at 3 years, given simultaneously for the interest, these three notes also drawing interest. This transaction is reached, exactly, upon banking principles. Such was the case of the Bank of Maine v. Butts. (w) $10,000 were loaned—4000 for 2 years, and. 6000 for 3 years—and small notes, dated at the same time, and payable at 3 years, were taken on interest to secure each accruing years’ interest upon the large notes. This was holden usurious : and the Court adopt the sensible distinction between a mere miscalculation, and an intention to compute by a usurious rule. Have the plaintiffs shown any mistake in their arithmetical calculations ? No. They understand themselves perfectly. They are right throughout, in fractions of years, months, &c., and the result is cor. rect. I hope the Court will keep in view the difference be *739tween a mere mistake of a figure, a miscalculation, and the voluntary application of a mistaken rule. In the latter case it is usury. It cannot be excused by the force of usage, or any other pretence. Suppose the merchants of a city should all lighten their weights, and contract their yards, could they shelter themselves under this usage, of their own creation, from the penalties inflicted for selling by false weights and measures 1 The agreement may be perfectly pure ; yet if more be taken than 7 per cent, as a premium for the loan, by force of any pretended rule or custom, it is void.(x) If the bank retained more than 7 per cent, knowingly, it was usury, though Wager did not know it. It is enough that the party who makes the loan understands the subject. The authority to the agent was, to pay what was demanded upon the third note. This was done. The bank demanded $18 09, and it was paid accordingly. The agent meets the proposition made by the bank. Usury never could be reached, if the counsel are allowed to refine away this case by saying that the bank acted without an usurious intent. It might as well be said they could have no criminal intention, because (being a corporation) they had no soul. E. Griffin, (same side.) It will be recollected, that the sum of $18 09, was taken for interest only. Here, then, is a case where an incorporation, created for the purpose of loaning money, and subject, like an individual, to the operation of the statute to prevent usury, have thought proper, deliberately, intentionally, and for years, to take over seven per cent, per annum. One would suppose, that the bare statement of facts would be a sufficient answer to all that has been, or can be said in justification of the practice adopted by the plaintiffs. The statute of usury declares, (y) “ that no person or persons, whomsoever, shall hereafter take, directly or indirectly, for the loan of any moneys, &c., above the value of £7, for the forbearance of £100 for one year ; and so after that rate, for a greater or lesser sum, or for a longer or shorter time.” All notes, &c.; for the payment of any principal or *740money lent, &c., are, by the same action declared utterly void. That the plaintiffs have taken more than at the rate of £7 in the hundred, for the loan, is proved by their own clerk, who was instructed, by the cashier of the institution, to receive it. It further appears, that they have taken interest in the same way for more than nine years. The statute declares the note void; and it would seem as though this Court had little else to do, except to permit the will of the legislature to have its effect. I will, however, proceed to examine the grounds relied upon by the plaintiffs’ counsel, in justification of taking over seven per cent, per annum for interest. It is said that there is no corrupt agreement. In the first section of the statute, and which is the section declaring the notes, &c., void, nothing is said about a corrupt agreement. The words are, that “no person or persons whomsoever shall take directly or indirectly.” One would suppose, from the words used, that if a person should intentionally take for interestover seven per cent, the statute would be violated, and the security void. If it was taken through mistake, by which I mean a mistake of the fact, I should certainly not consider the statute violated. But if intentionally taken, the note is either void, or the statute for the prevention of usury is a dead letter. The will of the legislature is nothing. The idea of the necessity of our proving a corrupt agreement, which is so emphatically required of us, is derived from the English decisions, which are mere expositions of the statute of Henry the 8th. A short examination of the English statutes of usury, and a comparison of them with our own, will furnish a sufficent reason for declaring those decisions inapplicable here though I do not wish to be understood as admitting, that the manner of taking the interest, in this case, does not furnish what the Court will feel itself bound to consider as conclusive evidence of a corrupt agreement, if any such evidence were necessary. The statute of Henry the 8th, which is the foundation of all the statutes against usury, and repealed all former acts, commences with these words: “ no person, by way of corrupt bargain, (fee., shall take, &c.” The statute of 21 Jac. 1, and 12 Car. 2, were passed with a view of reducing the rate of in*741terest, leaving the statute of Henry the 8th, in all other respects, in full force. The statute of Anne reduces the rate to 5 per cent, and declares the contracts and securities for more void. These statutes being all in pari materia, are to be construed together; and, therefore, it is necessary, under the English statutes, that there should be a corrupt agreement. Our statute says, “If any person shall take directly or indirectly,” without saying, by way of corrupt bargain, “ the security shall be void.” The English decisions on the statute of Henry the 8th, are therefore inapplicable, owing to the manifest difference of language used in the two statutes. It may be urged, that this construction includes the man who takes over 7 per cent, by mistake. I answer no; for the man who receives over 7 percent, not knowing that he does so receive, is not within the statute. The taking within the statute is an act of the will as well as the hand. It is not necessary that one should agree to give, and another tq take over 7 per cent, to make the security void. I put a case; suppose a person, about to discount a note, should calculate interest or discount at 8 per cent.-; the borrower not knowing the manner of calculating, but supposing that the interest was calculated at 7 per cent, takes the money, deducting this discount. Is not this usurious ? • Is not the security void, by the first section of the statute ? Would it be any answer to the defence of usury, that the borrower did not agree to pay the 8 per cent. ? that there was no corrupt agreement; and,"" therefore, that the security was not void, but good? Would it lie in the mouth of the lender to say to the borrower, “ True, sir, I took for the loan of my money over 7 per cent, but you did know it at the'time; therefore you did not agree to pay over 7 per cent, and, therefore, my security is good ?” This is, in substance, the language of those who would urge the necessity of our proving a corrupt agreement, for the purpose of making the security void. According to this, “if the borrower had known the fact, that that he was paying over 7 per cent, then the security would be void ; but because the lender had taken the excess in a secret manner, the transaction is not corrupt, and the secu*742rity is good. But does not the borrower agree to pay the usury <i jje agrees to pay, and does pay the sum demanded for interest. Is not here, then, an agreement on the part of the borrower as well as the lender, provided any such agreement was necessary? If I am hot correct, the lender is permitted to say to the borrower, “ because the corruption is all on my side; because I have clandestinely taken from you over 7 per cent.; therefore I am- to be put in a better situation than I could have been, provided I had acted openly and fairly.” The plaintiffs appear - with an ill grace to allege the ignorance of the borrower. Whether he was ignorant that the plaintiffs were taking over 7 per cent, does not appear, and the plaintiffs ""can never be permitted to make the allegation. It has been said, that the bank did- not intend to violate the statute of usury, and, therefore, the security is not void. If a bank, or an individual, will adopt a mode of calculating interest by which they get over 7 per cent, they can never allege a want of intent, on their part, to violate the statute. If they will adopt a mod,e of calculating interest which is illegal, they must be responsible for the consequences ; for ignorance of law will excuse no man. The very adoption of such a mode is, in law and in fact, evidence, and that conclusive too, of an intention to violate the statute, as well as of a corrupt agreement. I refer the Court to the Bank of Maine v. Butts, (z) for the purpose of showing what was there regarded as conclusive evidence of a corrupt agreement. The defence in that case, was usury; and the plaintffs put their right to take the sum which they bad received for interest, on the usage of banks. Sewall J. concludes his opinion in these words : “ It is probable, that in this case, there was no intentional deviation on the part of the bank, but a mistake of their right. This, however, is a consideration which must not influence our decision. The mistake Was not involuntary, as a miscalculation might be considered when an intention of conforming to the legal rule of interest, was proved, but a *743voluntary departure from the rate. An excess of interest was intentionally taken, upon a mistaken supposition that banks were privileged, in this respect, to a certain extent. This was, therefore, in the sense of the law a corrupt agreement; for ignorance of law will not excuse.” It is difficult to imagine expressions more applicable to the case at bar. They are conclusive against the plaintiffs. It is difficult to conceive how the plaintiffs could be mistaken. Yet if mistaken, it was a mistake of the law, which can excuse no man. In the sense of the law, the taking, under such circumstances, was corrupt. The opinion in the case of the Bank of Maine v. Butts, was given upon solemn argument, by a Court of the first respectability, and although not binding as authority, is entitled, considering the eminent legal acquirements of the members composing that Court, to great consideration and respect. The amount in controversy was sufficient to induce that Court to consider well the grounds of their decision. The opinion of the Court, in that case, undoubtedly received the sanction of the then Chief Justice of that Court, who has justly been styled the Mansfield of America. The maxim, ignorantia legis neminem ex cus at, is founded in the clearest reason, and the most evident necessity. Civil society could not, possibly exist without it. If ignorance could be alleged in justification, or in excuse for the violation of a law of general application, civil society would be at an end. This maxim is equally applicable to criminal as to civil jurisprudence. Blackstone says,(a) if a man thinks that he has a right to kill an excommunicated person, and does kill him, he is guilty of murder; for ignorance of law can never be alleged as an excuse, even in a criminal proceeding. The intention to kill was not more evident in the case put by Blackstone, than the intention, on the part of the bank, to take this interest. If the allegation of ignorance could not avail, in the case of murder, a fortiori, it ought not in the case of usury. The plaintiffs in this case intended to do every thing which the law makes necessary to constitute the offence of usuiy, and yet allege their innocence. They intended to get over 7 per cent, for interest on their loans, and then protect themselves by an allegation, *744that they did not intend to be guilty of usury. If such pretences can avail them, the whole system of legal government is subverted. Usury or not, say the plaintiffs’ counsel, is a question of intent. In this we agree. How is this intent to be ascertained ? Did the lender intend to take over 7 per cent, for interest ? is the inquiry, in all cases. If he did, then is there an end to the question of usury. This is a matter of fact, to be submitted to a jury, and if the jury find that the excess was taken for interest, the security is void. If they find that the excess can fairly be referred, in the transaction, to something else besides interest, then' the security is not void, because over 7per cent, has not been taken for interest. It is proved, in this case, that it was, and that, too, intentionally ; and the only question is, whether such an act is usury 1 This is a question of- law; or, in other words, what does the statute to prevent usury say a man may take for the forbearance of a loan of money ? In Hammett v. Yea,(b) the question was, whether the transaction was usurious. The lender had gotten more than at the rate of 5 per cent, and whether the excess was to be called interest, or whether it could be fairly referred to something else, as remittance, was the question. The Chief Justice commences by saying, “ 1 will begin with stating my assent to the proposition, that when a party on a contract for a loan intentionally takes over 5 per cent, per annum for the forbearance of that loan, he is guilty of usury. But I add to this the further proposition, that whether more than 5 per cent, is intentionally taken upon any contract for such forbearance, is a mere question of fact for the consideration of the jury, and must always be collected from the whole transaction, as it passed between the parties.” If the jury had found that over 5 per cent, was intentionally taken for interest, then, according the opinion of Chief Justice Eyre, the transaction would have been usurious. Now the very fact which it was necessary there for the jury to find, is here proved by the clerk of the bank. Will it be pretended, that the plaintiffs have not intentionally taken this $18 09, when it is proved that they have been in tire habit of taking interest in the same way, upon all *745their discounts, since 1812; and when all the calculations have been made according to the directions of their cashier ? Will it be pretended, that any part of this $18 09 is referable to any thing else besides interest, when their clerk swears that it was taken for interest, and when, on the trial, they contended that they had a right to take this sum as interest ? Chief Justice Eyre goes on to say, “ If there be any over-plus after the 5 per cent, taken for discount, whether this overplus be referable to some lawful collateral consideration or not, is a question of fact for the jury.” In this case the Court considered the discounting of the bills, and the remittance of the’ money, as separate and distinct transactions ; that is, the 5 per cent, is paid the banker as discount, and the excess as a compensation for the remittance of the money to London j, and, therefore the transaction was not usurious. Marsh v. Martindale. (c) In this case the jury found, that the plaintiffs' did°not intend'to be guilty of usury. Lord Alvanley, Ch. J. says, “ I stated to the jury, that if a man agree to take over 5 per cent, for the forbearance of money, the law declares such an agreement corrupt, within the meaning of the statute of Anne, whether the party thought, at the time, that he was taking usury or not. The finding of the jury does not prevent the Court from inquiring into the transaction, and declaring it corrupt, if it be so in point of fact.” In this case the Court, believing the transaction usurious, pronounced it so, contrary to the finding of the jury. According to the opinion in this case, it is of little consequence what the lender thought about the purity of the transaction, provided it is in law corrupt. All the authorities agree in this, that whether the lender intend to take over the legal rate of interest, is a question of fact for the jury. Yet if the jury should find contrary to law, declaring that not usurious .which in law is clearly so, the Court will set aside that finding. The law, then, has fixed the intent with which a man acts, who takes over 7 per cent, for interest, deliberately and knowingly. ■ The case explains the manner in which the excess was obtained; by calling a year 360 days, and a month 30, in all their calculations. Shortening the time *746raises the rate; and it would be as legal: for the plaintiffs to ma]£e a]] their calculations at 8 per cent; as to call less than 365 days a year. All commercial transactions prove the year to contain 365 days, and all banks, when they wish to protest a note payable one year after date, consider the year as containing 365 days. The statute of usury speaks of taking £7 for the forbearance of £100 for one year, and; so for a longer or shorter period. The legislature, when they regulated the rate of interest, had no reference to interest for months. The only true way of calculating is, to consider any number of days less than a year, as parts of a year, and take interest accordingly. A month, in the commercial transactions of this- country, contains either 28, 29, 30- or 31 days, and this inequality of days in a month clearly shows the impropriety of our calculating by months. Suppose a note payable one month after date, and dated 10th of February : according to the practice- of the Utica, bank,, they would get the interest for 33 days, when the borrower had the use of the money for 31 days only; there being 18 days in February and 13 in March, including the days of grace. In this way, the public are compelled to pay at the rate' of 7 per cent, per annum, when the money is loaned only for 336 days. Suppose a note payable six months after date, is discounted at the bank of Utica;. when is that note, according to the law of the land, to be protested for the purpose-of fixing the endorser ? on the 185th, 6th or 7th day; as the months; may be, including the days of grace ? If we consider 185 days as a part of 365, as by law I contend we are bound to do, the interest of $1000 for the time is $35-37. If the calculation is made- 30: days to a month, accordingto the practice of the plaintiffs, it amounts to- $35 98, and is made up by a-perfect contradiction of. the principle upon which they proceed, when they calculate time for the purpose of protesting this same note. The plaintiffs, on the trial of this cause at the circuit, in justification of their practice; offered to prove the usage or - custom of banks. To the introduction of this evidence, the counsel for the-defendant objected; but: his honor the presiding Judge admitted the evidence subject to. the exception. This Gourfc are; therefore, called upon to say whether this *747proof of usage or custom is legal, and whether sufficient was proved, and in a proper manner, to justify the plaintiffs. This practice of the plaintiffs is either justified by the lex mercatoria, or custom of merchants, or by a usage which is proved by the clerk of the bank to have prevailed for 9-years among a certain set of men, and which this Court is now called upon to sanction. What, then, is the lex mercatoria, and how is it to be proved 1 According to Blackstone,(d) it is a particular system of customs, used only among one set of the king’s subjects, “ which, however different from the rules of the common law, is yet ingrafted into it and made a part of it; being allowed for the benefit of trade, to be of the utmost importance in all commercial transactions. For it is. a maxim of law, that cuilibet in arte credendum est.” The law relating to bills of exchange, and all mercantile contracts, are as much the general law of the land, as the laws relating to marriage or murder. The lex mercatoria, or law merchant, is part of the common law of the land. In one case,(e) the question was, whether a bill of exchange payable to order, becomes negotiable, and may be endorsed over, without the word order in the endorsement. On the trial at nisi prius, Lord Mansfield permitted the defendants to prove the usage of merchants in such a case. Witnesses were sworn on both sides. The jury found a verdict for the defendants. The plaintiffs moved for a new-trial, and alleged that the proof of usage of merchants ought not to have been received, because the law was already settled. Lord. Mansfield, in giving his opinion, on the motion for a new trial says, “ since the trial, I have looked into the cases and thought much about it, and am clearly of opinion, that I ought not to have admitted any evidence of the particular usage of merchants in such a case. Of this I say 1 am now satisfied, for the law is already settled.” He says further, “ the point now in question, has already been solemnly settled both in the King’s Bench and Common Pleas, by two adjudications; and, therefore, witnesses ought not to ■ have been called after such solemn determinations oí what the law was.” Dennison and Foster, Js. concurred, for the *748reasons expressed by Lord Mansfield. Mr. Justice Wilmot sz¿^ u fae cust0m of merchants is part of the common law of England, and courts of law must take notice of it as such.” He further adds, “ if there be a doubt about the custom, it may be fit and proper to take the opinion of merchants thereupon ; yet that is only when the law remains doubtful.” “ Therefore,” he says, “ these judicial determinations of the point are the lex mercatoria, as to this question, for they settle what is the custom of merchants, which is the lex mercatoria, which is the law of the land. But this finding of the jury is directly contrary to the lex mercatoria, which is so fully settled and established by legal adjudications.” The law merchant is, therefore, a part of the common law, and in order to ascertain this law, we always resort to legal decisions. If a question respecting the law merchant has once been established by judicial decisions, these are the only evidence which Courts receive of what the law is. Any other practice would be derogatory to Courts, by rendering the wavering and unstable opinions of individuals, of greater weight and authority than the solemn and deliberate opinions of judicial tribunals. What, then, is the custom which the plaintiffs seek to establish? They say that they have always considered a month as 30 days, and a year as 360; and they say that they are justified in this by the usage or custom of banks. All judicial determinations, from the earliest cases, settle the law, as applicable to bills of exchange and promissory notes, that a year contains 365, and a month 28,29,30 or 31 days. The law on this subject is fully established by judicial determinations,- and, according to the opinion of Lord Mansfield, Edie v. The East India Company, (f) no proof of usage was admissible. Can it be pretended that a year is of one length when they wish to calculate interest, and of another and different when they wish to fix an endorser by protest? And is the same law merchant to bear them out in these two conflicting pretensions? This is the practice which the plaintiffs gravely ask the Court to sanction,' and entail upon posterity, in opposition to the known and estab *749lished law of the land regulating time, and in the teeth too, of a statute of usury, which speaks a language too plain to he misunderstood, and whose provisions are too salutary to be disregarded. Custom or usage may be proved for the purpose of showing that the excess, if any, was not taken for interest, but as a compensation for remittance, commissions, &c., not for the purpose of justifying the taking over the rate fixed by law. No usage can justify this,(g) any more than it could control an express contract.(h) in the case of Dunham v. Gould (i) the Chancellor in giving the opinion of the Court, says, “ It is perfectly idle to talk of a custom of merchants to take a commission above the legal rate of interest, on the exchange of notes. Custom of merchants is not applicable to such a case.. It is not matter of trade and commerce within the law merchant, and if there were such a local usage in New York, it would be null and void, and could not be set up as a pretext or cover to trample down the law of the land. The money lenders throughout the country might as well set up a practice of their own, and then plead it in bar of the statute.” If the practice of the plaintiffs is adjudged good, then the practice of six or eight banks in this state will, in effect, be pleaded in bar of the statute. They will be permitted to trample down the law of the land. Lord Loughborough,(j) says, that the custom of trade to take over five per cent, (or the legal rate of interest of England) cannot authorize a greater demand than five per cent. The language of Lord Mansfield, used in the case of Jestons v. Brooke, (k) when speaking of the case of Floyer v. Edwards, (l) will not warrant the idea that usage, be it ever so constant, would justify the taking of usury ; on the contrary, he expressly says it will not. The inquiry in the case of Floyer v. Edwards, was, whether the transaction was a borrowing and lending, and in this view the usage was taken into consideration. In one case,(m) the defendant undertook to set up a custom in Southampton, that a pound should be 18 oz. The statutes of England having fixed the pound at 16, Lord Ken*750yon says this custom cannot be supported. Among othertHiiigs, he says, “ as well might it be contended that a custom could prevail in a particular place, that a certain numher of days less than seven should constitute a week.” Rex v. Major, (n) was a conviction on the 23 Car. 2, for buying corn on the 23d July, 1791, at Newport,in-the Isle of Wight, different from the Winchester bushel. It appeared by the evidence set forth in the conviction, that the corn was bought by the customary measure used in the Isle of Wight, which contains a pint more than the Winchester measure. The defendent was convicted in the sum of 30s. and £10 15, the Value of the corn. The Court, notwithstanding this strong proof of usage-or custom, sustained the conviction. In this case, too, it appeared- that subsequent acts of parliament, requiring the return-of corn, had noticed the custom, and required the return according to such customary measure. It was contended that these subsequent acts had"" repealed the statute, 22 Car; 2, and justified the custom. Lord Kenyon held otherwise, and said, “ we cannot get rid of these pósitive statutes.” In Rex v. Arnold, (o) the buyer in Huntington, was convicted of purchasing corn different from the Winchester measure. Lord Kenyon refers to this custom of farmers, which existed in many parts of the kingdom, and regrets that their obstinacy should have prevented the operation of the statute of Charles the 2d. The defendant was convicted, notwithstanding the proof of custom. These are strong and conclusive authorities to show that a custom however well proved, or however prevalent, cannot be set up in opposition to the law of the land. In most countries, guards have been provided by law, against impositions upon community, in the use of false weights and"" measures. This is highly penal in our own state, (p) and the offender, in public estimation, is justly consj:qereq jnfaIhous. Courts of justice have always been rigid in enforcing these statutes, inflicting punishment for the most trifling violation. Why was this ? The reason is obvious ; because weights and measures are of constant and daily use in our dealings with one another, and because the frequent use of the same false weight or measure would *751enable its possessor to commit extensive injury upon his customers. That the variation is small, while it manifests a meaness in depravity, has a tendency to shield the offender from punishment. The injury becomes great by repetition. An extensivo merchant, by little and little, filches property from his customers, by the use of false weights and measures. What would Courts of Justice say to such a merchant, who, when indicted should, as the plaintiffs have done in this"" case, plead the extensiveness of the practice. Would; they not say, that “ the law, and not the practice of others is to be your guide, and what you offer in justification shows, if true, the necessity of an immediate corrective.” For the purpose of showing what usages are good, and how far they are to operate when proved, and the manner of proving them, I refer the Court to the cases of Thomas v. Graves and Toomer, (q) Same v. O’Hara, (r) Cotton v. Johnson, (s) and Trott v. Wood.(t) Errors merely acquiesced in, do not constitute the law. In Leach v.Pargiter (u) the practice under the Lord’s act, had been one way for 30 years, but was altered the first time the statute came under the consideration of the Court. In Butt v. Conant, (v) speaking of usage, Dallas, Ch. J. says, “ if the practice were against the first principles of constitutional law, and an evident* encroachment upon the rights of the subject, I would go even the length of saying, if it were of this discretion, and were sanctioned by the expressions of one of the Judges, in such a case I would not hold it to be law if it had"" existed from the foundation of Rome.” A custom contrary to public good, or injurious to a multitude and beneficial only to some particular persons, is repugnant to the- law of reason, and consequently void.(w) The Judges say, in things against law and reason, usage is to no purpose(x) Customs ought to be beneficial to all, , , , i , . ? . „ ’ but may be good when agamst the interests of particular persons, if for the public good.(y) A custom that begins by the extortion of lords of manors, is judged wanting a lawful beginning, and therefore void(z) *752The case of Rex v. Major (a) also shows that statutes passe¿ after the existence of the custom or usage is known, and in some measure sanctioning them, by authorizing re-turns according to the custom, do not affect a general law in relation to the same subject. If the legislature knew, at the time they incorporated the plaintiffs, that banks were in the habit of calling 360 days a year, when calculating interest, this case shows that such a circumstance will .furnish no argument for exempting them from the operation of a permanent and plain law of the land. In the language of Ld. Kenyon, they cannot get rid of the operation of such a positive law as the statute of usury. The convictions under the com laws, were upon penal statutes, where the utmost strictness is observed in construction, and the greatest latitude allowed in defence. They go to prove, beyond all controversy, that, on an iudictment, against a natural person, the facts shown in this case would ensure his conviction.' The Court will find, if they examine the acts incorporating the different banks in this state, that most of them are restricted in their discounts, to six per cent, and those in the city of New York, which are not so restricted, usually confine themselves to that rate, otherwise they could not do business. Now a bank that takes at the rate of 6 per cent, may call any number of days, less than 365 a year, and calculate interest accordingly, provided they do not get over 7 per cent. The undoubtedly violate their charter, but are not guilty of usury. It may be supposed, that the amount received was too trifling for the notice of a Court of Justice, and that judgment would therefore be given for the plaintiffs. I will not for a moment entertain the idea that such a supposition is correct. The statute of usury must be protected from the most trifling violations, or not at all. The legislature have set bounds to the unfeeling and avaricious lender, which he is not to pass with impunity; and that Court is guilty of treachery to the public, that does not confine him within legislative limits. The Judge would ill deserve a seat upon the bench of justice, who should let his decision be at all influenced by the amount which the violator of the statute *753had received. If 26 cents can be received upon the statute with impunity, so can 26 dollars, and there is nothing to be done by a Court of Justice but rigidly to adhere to the rate fixed by statute. In the case of Rex v. Major, (b) the difference between the two measures was trifling, and yet 'J' "" no one ever thought of urging that as an argument in favor of the defendant’s acquittal. 1 challenge gentlemen to point out a case where the amount received has ever been taken into consideration, for the purpose of deciding whether the transaction was usurious. If the amount exceeds the rate fixed by statute, it is usurious ; no matter how trifling the excess. The cases authorizing the taking of interest in advance, may be cited for this purpose. I was aware of the case of The Manhattan Company v. Osgood, (c) cited on the other side, and I am also aware that that decision is not supported by the authorities relied on. Yet if that case is introduced for the purpose of showing that the violations- of the plaintiffs are to be sanctioned, it proves too much; for we then have no statute of usury at all; and if this is the extent to which that decision is to lead, I trust this Court will pronounce it not law. Something has been said, and more probably will be, in regard to the consequences of a decision against the plaintiffs. This is an argument seldom resorted to when other substantial grounds can be taken. It is generally the last, and with parties situated like the plaintiffs, the most desperate effort. Such arguments, however, can never assist any person in arriving at the truth. In the case of Waters v. Stewart, (d) Chief Justice Spencer, in giving his opinion in the Court of Errors, says, “ arguments ab inconvenienti have been suggested. There can scarcely exist a case, however well settled, where such arguments cannot be urged. They prove nothing, and should be listened to only in doubtful cases.” In the case of Langdon v. Potter and others, (e) Chief Justice Parsons says, “ arguments drawn from inconvenience, are to have weight only in doubtful cases.” In the present case nothing is doubtful. Private statutes, made for the accommodation of particular citizens or corporations, ought not so to be construed as *754to affect the rights or privileges of others, unless s.uch com stmction results from express words or necessary implication.(f) It may he well, perhaps, since arguments ab inconvenienti have been used for the plaintiffs, to turn the attention of the Court, for a moment, to the consequences of a decision against .the defendant. The plaintiffs by calling 360 days a year, have, ever since their incorporation, made every 73d dollar of discount oyer 7 per cent. The .only true way of testing the operation .of any practice-is, by viewing its consequences for a long course of years, and for the purpose of showing this, I have made a calculation, giving its effect upon one million of dollars for a century. By this calculation it will appear, thatin a century, over twelve millions of dollars will be illegally taken. This makes an annual average of 120,000 dollars. The circulating medium of the United States is probably not far from 150,000,000. The amount of the annual ayerage which would be thus illegally taken, upon the principle .contended for by the plaintiffs from the whole United States, over .and above 7 per cent, would be 18.000,000. The inconsiderable sum which will probably be lost by a judgment against the plaintiffs, compared with the enormous tax which will certainly be entailed upon community by a contrary decision, sinks into utter insignificance. The amount which will be lost to the plaintiffs, will, in all prpbability, fall far short of xvhat they have illegally tqken; and it is of immense importance to a growing commercial country like ours, that questions of this sort should be settled upon true principles. If we were compelled to make pur loans from foreigners, upon the principles contended for by the plaintiff’s counsel, the effect would be utter destruction. In a very short time the whole wealth of the country would be exhausted by such illegal exactions. Compared with such a state of things, the paltry tax npon tea, which contributed to produce the revolution, would have been insignificant indeed. The restrictions against usury are founded on the strongest reasons of policy and morality; they have, therefore, been imposed in almost every age and country. It is no law of doubtful policy or ex *755pediency which you are called upon by the defendant to enforce. It is a law which the greatest and the best of Judges have felt bound to watch with unceasing vigilance, guarding its provisions from the most trifling infractions, and enforcing its penalties fearless of consequences. It is a law which our very nature renders necessary, and which has been hallowed by the sanction of accumulated ages. It is not like some exploded edict of despotic power, preserved as a pretext for plunder and oppression. It is one of the few restraints which, in the most corrupt times, have always been placed, even by the very worst rulers, upon the rapacity of the worst part of community, for the protection of the poorest. It is prohibited by the common law, and the punishménts inflicted for its restraint have been rigorous and severe. It is laid down in the books as a sound rule of construction, and in some cases by legislative enactment, that the statute shall, in all cases, be construed most strongly against the usurer. Though the borrower was formerly considered a parficeps criminis, that idea is now justly exploded, considering that he is in the power of the lender, and necessarily submits to his terms. The desire of gain insensibly vitiates the heart. It was, therefore, wise for governments to erect a shield over the weaknesses, and a check upon the passions of men, to protect those oppressed with pecuniary embarrassments from the depredations of unfeeling avarice, and to guard weak and unfortunate individuals from the fangs of the Shylock. All privileged associations should be watched with Argus eyes. They should be regarded with distrust. It is the duty of Courts to keep them within the bounds prescribed by the legislature. They are opposed to the genius of our government, and if tolerated, should not be permitted to abuse the privileges with which they are entrusted. These considerations apply with peculiar force to incorporated banks. Drawing around them, as they evidently do, a silent yet powerful influence in the neighborhood where they are situated, they will ever be watched with jealously by a people alive to their rights and liberties. Banks being granted for the express purpose of loaning mo*756ney, the rule of construction of the statute of usury will not p,e softened in their favor. If the principle contended for by the opposite counsel be correct, what salutary statute can hereafter stand against the usages of trade 1 What law can hereafter be enacted, which may not be trodden down by the custom of banks. D. Cady, in reply. It is certainly well settled by the authorities cited in the opening, that to constitute usury, so as to avoid the security, there must be a corrupt agreement. No case has been produced to the contrary. If this be necessary, then, in order to constitute the offence with which we are charged, we must have had an associate. It is difficult to conceive how there can be a corrupt agreement, without there being two parties. These are essential to every contract. Who is the person with whom we have made the corrupt bargain charged upon us ? Not the defendant. He disavows it. It is denied that he knew any thing of the usury, till some time after the note in question was discounted ; and his counsel complain that he has been practised upon from the beginning, without knowing any thing of the imposition. All is a recent discovery. Now I propose to show conclusively, that there never was a case of usury without the concurrence of two parties. Smith v. Beach, (g) is a respectable authority to this point, and will be found to accord as well with the spirit of all the cases, as with reason and common sense. The point there directly decided, was that a corrupt agreement, in which the minds of the parties meet, is necessary to constitute usury ; and, therefore, where more than lawful interest was reserved, with the knowledge of the lender, but without the knowledge of the borrower, it was held that the transaction was not usurious. The reasoning of the Court is directly applicable to this case, and, if it be law, is conclusive in favor of the plaintiffs. “ A corrupt agreement (they say) is essential to constitute usury; and, to form a corrupt agreement, as in all other contracts, the minds of the parties must meet. The assent of Beach (the defendant) was, therefore, as essential to the existence of an usurious agreement *757as that of Bird, (the plaintiffs’ testator.) From these premises it follows, as an undeniable consequence, that there could be no corrupt agreement, while either of the parties remained ignorant of the excessive reservation; and the jury ought to have been so instructed.” It will be seen, by that case, that the Connecticut statute is the same, in substance as our own. The same arguments were urged as here, against the necessity of a corrupt agreement. It was said to be enough that the lender voluntarily made an usurious reservation ; and oí the fact that he did so there was no dispute : but the law was denied by the Court. • The ignorance of the borrower precluded the possibility of an agreement. The several provisions in the 1st and 2d sections of the statute of usury,(h) show, that the distinction between the two cases, of a corrupt agreement and the receipt of excessive interest by the lender without the concurrence of the borrower, was intended to be kept up by the legislature. The 1st section provides for the case of taking excessive interest for the forbearance of money, or reserving it by certain contracts or securities. If so taken or reserved, the contract or security is declared void. The contract itself is vitiated by the corrupt agreement. The second section was intended to provide for taking usurious interest, in the same way, and it gives the remedy. Within one year the borrower may recover back the excess. If not knowingly paid, the statute could never have intended to confine him to the year. If ignorantly paid, he has the six years, and might recover it back, upon the general principle, that it was money paid through mistake or fraud. It stands on the same footing as money twice paid on a note by mistake. Suppose an illiterate man to borrow $100, and the lender fraudulently draws, and procures him to sign a note for $105. This would not be void for usury, but for fraud; whereas, if the lender should say, I must have $105, and the borrower then should sign a note for that sum, it would be void for usury. If gentlemen are willing to abide by their own admissions, the case is against them. They are loud in urging the entire ignorance of their client that any excess was de*758manded; and, indeed, this is plain from the proof, if the con cesga3Q had not been made. The .defendant never thought of an .usurious .contract. It was made out by calculation . * *' and inference. The note is presented and the money re? cejved, silently, in the ordinary course of business, without dreaming of usury. Neither Maynard nor Spencer were authorized to part with the notes at an usurious rate of dispount. The circumstances under which the second note Was discounted are not' explained; but, as to the first and second, both parties agree that the defendant acted unwittingly. If th.e agent had sworn that he paid $40 excess, without knowing what he was about, it might have been recovered back within 6 years, in an action for money had and received, upon ¡general, principles, but the note would not b.e void -for usury. The first counsel for the defendant conceded, that if the second note was valid, w.e may recover for that. If void, we may go for the first, if that he good. Upon the latter, it is said we took interest for three days, which it had already run when presented for discount; but was it not, to all legal purposes, discounted on' the 12th of September. It was car? ried for discount on that day, and on an objection being made to the form of the note, another was afterwards substituted in an acceptable shape, which was actually discounted upon the 15th. The money was, then, virtually set apart for this purpose upon the 12th, There was a proposition to do it, which was afterwards executed. Take the case of a request for a loan in the morning, and the money laid apart for the purpose, but not actually counted out till the next day, when the loan is completed : would it not be iniquitous to object usury 1 The Court are called upon to presume what the contract was ; for none of an usurious nature is shown; and they will not make a presumption which shall involve the party in guilt. But what is the legal date of a note 1 It is the time of . deliyery.(i) This was on the 15th of April, when a discount for 90 days was rightly taken $ for it had that time to run. an actj0¡3 been prosecuted before the expiration of that time, it would not have lain. The Court would rather presume this to have been the contract, than impute the crime *759of usury. Suppose the note had been ante-dated a year, by mistake, and the discount for a quarter taken. The Court would still say to the holder, “ your engagement was to wait the 90 days, for which you may take the discount; but cannot sue before the expiration of the time.” It is said, that our miscalculation was intentional; but this is not necessarily so. Will the Court presume it ? The division of time is of human invention ; and there is no such absolute certainty and plainness in measuring, as to preclude mistake. We are told that the statute speaks of a year, or a longer or shorter time, and that quarters and months are not taken into account; but we are not informed what operation to adopt, in order to reach the law of less than a year. You divide 365 days by 12, if you are seeking for a month, and reject the fractions. This gives a quotient of 30, which multiplied by 3 gives 90 days, or a quarter of a year, if fractions are still to be disregarded. Upon this principle, on a 60 day’s loan, you get the interest for a year, and divide by 6. But suppose 90 days are improperly called £ of a year: on looking at the calculation, the Court will see that the interest is calculated for 90 days, excluding the first or day of the date, which was also the day of the lending; so that, in truth, the only question is, whether the lender is entitled to interest on the day upon which he loans the money. Is it to be tolerated, that we are to forfeit our security for the whole sum, merely because we have charged interest for the first day? Will the Court say, that because the calculation happens to cover that day, that so small a mistake, even if it be one, shall overturn the whole demand ? But is it a mistake ? Every law book, speaking of time, tells us that fractions of a day are to be rejected. This is an established general rule, and only to be departed from when it becomes material to inquire beyond it, upon principles of necessity, or for the sake of equity. Are we to be stigmatized as usurers on such a ground as this ? It was not our fault that we discounted the second note before the first had run out; though be this as it may, it could not change the character of the first note. But such a transaction is not usury, even if it is to be deemed a con*760tmuation of the first. The party was under a necessity of obtaining a discount of his note thus early, in order to comply with the course of business which is universal at the banks throughout the commercial community. It was in reference to the discount days, which cannot be so regulated as to meet the views of individuals. Upon the question coming up in Brown v. Harraden,(j) whether 3 days of grace are to be allowed upon a promissory note, Ld. Kenyon gives great influence to the universal practice which prevailed on this subject. He says,(k) “ in addition to these considerations, we are now told that it has been the constant practice at the bank, and at the principal bankers, to make this allowance on promissory notes. Then, if we were to make a decision in opposition to all this practice, it would be attended with the most serious consequences ; for these notes are circulated not only throughout this country, but also over several other countries of Europe. Many of them have been discounted, and interest taken, on the supposition that 3 days of grace are allowed. But if we were to determine that no such allowance ought to have been made, all those parties would be involved in the crime of usury.” This case goes, moreover, to show the weight which is given to arguments ab inconvenienti, upon these commercial questions. The consequences, to be deprecated are, the overthrow of floating paper, which has always been supposed to be good, and the involving thousands of innocent men, who never dreamed that they were taking excessive interest, in the crime of usury. We accede the distinction made between mistakes of law and mistakes of fact. Knocking a man down in the street, or shooting at him, and taking his life, will constitute murder, whether the offender knows that it comes within the legal definition of this crime or not. But the two cases of Brown v. Harraden, (l) and Glassford v. Laing and others, (m) furnish a complete illustration of the distinction between a mere mistake of the law, and the one insisted upon in this case. We claimed the right to have the first day upon each note included. This is the mistake, if it can, bo calkiá one *761We intended no more than 7 per cent, for the whole time; and the mistake of including the first day was one of fact merely. ■ Floyer v. Edwards, (n) was cited in order to show that the intention of the parties is material; that they must both concur in the bargain ; and the Maine Bank v. Butts,(o) with the same view. No mistake, in these cases, was pretended. There could be none. The latter was of notes palpably usurious. It was the case of taking two distinct notes for the same money. A note is taken, say for the principal, at three years : other notes are taken for a part of the same sum, at the same time, at shorter dates. This is the case of the Maine Bank v. Butts, yet the question of intention was left open to be referred to a jury ; and that question is always involved, where a party is on trial for a crime. There are certain offences to which knowledge is essential, and must be averred in an indictment. The crime of passing counterfeit money is one. Usury is another. The intention of the parties is here the git of the inquiry, and must always be left for the jury to pass upon. A man takes 8 per cent, ignorantly: unexplained, it would be usury. If shown to have been accident, it would be otherwise. Thus, even in 'the Maine Bank v. Butts, the act of taking the smaller notes was open to explanation, and the prima facie case, made out by the defendant, might have been done away, by proof on the other side. It is complained, that our calculations were made in secret ; that the business was so managed that they could not be comprehended by the borrower. But what ought the Court to infer under all these circumstances 1 Here is plainly room for mistake. What should the presumption, be ? Glassford v. Laing and others, (p) and Buckley v. Guildbank, (q) are strong cases to show that where the Court can infer a mistake in taking the excess, they will do it, in order to avoid imputing the offence of usury. Taking a trifling excess beyond the legal interest, according to an extensive practice among money lenders, is a subject also of this rule of presumption in favor of innocence. “ Thus, Lord Mansfield, in Floyer v. Edwards :(r). “ Upon a nice calcula*762tionit will be found, that the practice of the bank in'discount' £ng bills, exceeds the' iate of five peí cent, for they take interest for the whole time the bills run, but pay only part of the money, to wit, by' deducting the' interest first; yet this is not usury.” The Manhattan Company v. Osgood, (s) Was decided upon the same principle. If gentlemen object to our rule of calculation, théy ought to have supplied us with a better.' The practice of calling 60 day's | of a year, in calculating interest, has prevailed for a great length of time ; and-, with a perfect knowledge Of this- practice, it will be seen- that almost- every act for incorporating banks refers- to 60 day nbtés. Being the most usual kind of bank paper, and understood in the long continued practice' of the commercial world to mean } Of a year, is it too much to say that the legislature referred to them in this character ? Indeed', they are, aS we have shown, in fact, f if you take them as the aliquot' part, and' reject the fraction. It was not- usurious to discount the 2d and 3d notes before the ones for which' they Were substituted fell due. If there-had’ been a'n origna! express agreement to this effect, it would ha^e’been another question; btit the existence of any such-agreement is negatived by the proof Sutherland, J. The note on' which this suit was brought, bears date the 14th of March, 1821, and is payable in 90 days-after date. It wás presented at the bank, on the l’5th : $18 09', paid as the discoúnt- and interest upon it'. It fell dfie on the 15th June. The interest was calculated as in the case of the New York Firemen Insurance Company v. Ely & Parsons, (a) upon' the principle that 90 days Were the fourth of a year'. This note was the second' renewal of One, dated the 12th of September, 1820, and discounted by plaintiff at 90 days. The interest was calculated upon the same principle, and the- same amount received upon this and the second as upon the last-nóte. It is unnecessary to consider the varioüs points' which were discussed in this'-casé; There ■ is' rtothin g fo take it Out of the operation of the' principle-established in The Firemen *763 Insurance Company v. Ely & Parsons ; that this mode of calculating the interest, renders the transaction usurious. Woodworth, J. concurred. Savage, Ch. J. To determine whether a contract is usurious, we must inquire, 1. Whether the subject of the contract is a loan ? 2. Whether more than lawful interest has been received or taken ? and 3. Whether it is the effect of a corrupt agreement ? In this case, there is no dispute upon the first question. It is denied, however, by the plaintiffs, that they have taken more interest than they were entitled to receive. The statute is very explicit, that no more than 7 pounds shall be taken for the loan of £100 for one year, and so after that rate for a greater or less sum, or for a longer or shorter time. The sum of $18 09, was received by the plaintiffs for the loan of $1000 for ninety-three days, and both the witnesses who have testified on that subject, have sworn that the interest on $1000 for that time, at 7 per cent, calculating 365 days to a year, amounts to $17 83 5. The fact is proved, then, that more than 7 per cent, has been received j and there is no pretence that it was taken by way of commissions or incidental charges. The custom, which is said to be universal, for all moneyed institutions, to calculate interest on 360 days as a year, can have no weight. It would be strange indeed, if the practice of any set of men, or companies of men, should become paramount to the authority of the legislature. With respect to most of these banks, who are said thus to calculate, it is well known that their loans are made at 6 per cent.; and although they receive more than six, yet the difference is not such as to amount to a violation of the statute against usury. Hence, perhaps, it is, that the custom hqs prevailed so generally. The excess amounts to a very little less than one tenth of 1 per cent. To an individual borrower, it is very trifling : to a bank, however, having an active capital of $500,000, this pittance will produce $500 per annum, and upon the whole active banking capital of the state, according to the the report of the Comptroller, it would produce $13,000. *764The amount, therefore, is too large to be entirely disregard e(^ t,eCause de minimis non curat lex. Again; it is alleged, that the plaintiffs have received interest for three days more than the true time included in the notes ; that is, they have received interest on $1000 for 279 days ; whereas the number of days from the 12th of September, 1820, to the 15th of June, 1821, reckoning one of these days inclusive, and the other exclusive, is 276 days only. So is the fact. The plaintiffs have, therefore, received the interest of those three days, at the rate of 14 per cent, per annum; for the second note was a renewal of the first, and the third a renewal of the second. Yet there is no evidence, showing that when either the first or second note was given, there was any stipulation for their renewal. The Clerk, who keeps the books of the bank, swears that each note was discounted on the day of its date; that on this being done, the proceeds were deposited to the credit of the person for whose use the discount was made ; and if he chooses to make a deposit several days before his note falls due, surely the bank ought not to be holden guilty of usury for receiving it, unless the transaction clearly appears to be a cover for usury, as in the Maine Bank v. Butts, (9 Mass. Rep. 49 to 55.) In that case, a loan was made of $10,000, payable part in 2 years, and part in 3 years. It appeared to be the practice of that bank, to take notes payable in 63 days ; and a week previous to the expiration of such notes, the borrower obtained a new loan of the same amount with which to meet the former. In that case it seems to have been part of the original contract, that the' borrowers of money from that bank should pay interest foi 70 days for every loan of 63 days ; and there was rea son to believe that the interest on the loan to Butts had been calculated on those principles, as the small notes given for the interest, greatly exceeded its lawful amount. It seems to have been supposed by the bank, also, that being authorized by their charter to transact business on banking principles, they were, thereby, exempt from the restrictions of the act to prevent usury. Judge Sewall, who gave the opinion of the Court, referring to the practice of renewing a *765note several days before its expiration, observes, that, “ while each note sustains a discount or deduction at the established rate of interest only, there is no offence against the statute for the prevention of usury.” This doctrine must certainly be admitted, with the qualification, that these renewals must not be used as a cover for usury. In the case under consideration, the renewals appear to have been made as near as possible to the time when the previous note became due, having regard to the established days of discount at the bank. Had more than one discount day intervened between the discount of the second note and payment of the first, the transaction would certainly have carried suspicion, at least, upon its face. The objection that interest was taken for several days between the date and the discount of the notes, or some of them, does not appear to be supported by the facts. The testimony is contradictory on the subject; but I think we ought rather to give preference to the Clerk of the bank who does not depend upon his memory, but upon entries made in the books of the bank at the time. In this respect we are performing the office of a jury, and ought not to be unnecessarily astute in detecting small unintentional errors, to defeat the recovery of a just demand. In making this remark, I mean not any reflection on the justice or policy of laws prohibiting usury. On the contrary, I believe such laws perfectly just and proper. They are necessary to protect the necessitous against their own acts of indiscretion. Nor would I impute moral guilt to those who receive more than the legal rate of interest, provided their exactions do not become oppressive. Usury is malum prohibitum— not malum in se. I am aware, that by some ancient English statutes, all usury was prohibited, as being against the law of God, the laws of the realm, and the law of nature. It was tolerated, however, by the law of Moses ; and allowed to be taken by Jews from the Gentiles; (Dent, xxiii. 20;) and, therefore, could not have been immoral in itself. The stat. 37 H. 8, c. 9, (A. D. 1546,) was the first statute of England, which permitted interest to be taken ; *766and 10 per cent, was allowed. This statute was repealed -n jggj . p,ut revived by the 13 El-iz. c. 8, (A. D. 1570,) 10 per cent, was again the lawful interest; and by this act,contracts; assurances, &c. whereby above 10per cent, should he reserved, or taken for. money lent, are made void. In 1623, the rate of interest was reduced to 8 per cent.in 1660, to 6 per cent.; and in 1713, by the 12 Anne, c. 16, to 5 per cent. . There is nothing in the objection, that interest was taken for the three days of grace ; for though the maker might have chosen to pay his note on the day when payable, yet the holder could not compel payment till after the expiration of the days of grace. To every practical purpose, therefore, the days of grace are part of the note itself. ’ Another objection (handed to the Court among the writ-: ten points, but upon which we refused to hear an argument) is, that it was usurious to take interest in advance without regard to the rules of rebate or discount. Were the question upon this practice res integra, I should think it a palpable violation of the statute. The bank lends a man $1000 for a year, but actually advances him $930 only: the other"" $70 they lend to somebody else, and deduct the interest ""again.: But for the purpose of the present illustration, I will suppose the whole""$70 lent. At the end of the year, then, they receive from the first borrower their principal, $1000 ; from, these cound borrower, £74 90 ; making an excess of $490, beyond legal interest, which on a capital of $500,000; will produce $2450. On the other hand,, if the borrower puts his $930 out at interest, he will have at the end of the year, $995 10 only, with which to pay the $1-000 borrowed.. He therefore loses $4 90 ; which the• bank gains beyond the lawful interest; whereas if they were to retain the discount instead of the interest, the borrower would receive- $934 58; the interest of which is $65: 42, giving him his $1000 at the end of the year. The bank, by again lending the discount,. ($65 42) would receive, at the end of the year,. ,1. The whole: amount of. the loan, $1000 00 *7672. The discount on $1000, 65 12 3. The interest on $65 42, 4 58 Making in all, . $1070 00 being the sum. loaned with 7 per cent, interest. Those banks who lend at 6 per cent, may safely adopt the practice of retaining the interest instead of the discount; sis the difference does not amount to quite half of 1 per cent.; they, therefore, do not violate the act to prevent usury. Plain as this case appears to my mind, it has been solemnly adjudged not to be usurious, both by this Court, (The Manhattan Company v. Osgood, 15 John. 168,) and by the Supreme Court of the United States. (Fleckner v. Bank of the U. S. 8 Wheat. 838.) Both Courts found their decision upon the practice of bankers and commercial convenience. Judge Story, in giving the opinion of the Court, (8 Wheat. 354,) observes, that an authority to make discounts, means an authority to receive the interest iti advance. The same doctrine has been recognized in Pennsylvania (Pawling's Exrs. v. Pawling's Adms. 4 Yeates’ Rep. 220,223 ;) and in Massachusetts, (Maine Bank v. Butts, 9 Mass. Rep. 49.) The point may, therefore, be considered settled until the legislature alter it, if they should think it proper or necessary ; but as the old ádjudications were different, it may be matter of curiosity, at least to trace its history. The oldest case which I have found where this doctrine was discussed, is Barnes v. Worlich, which is reported in Cro. Jac. 25; Moor, 644; Yelv. 30; Noy, 41; and 1 Bulstr. 20. These reporters disagree in some particulars; but they all concur in the point, that deducting the interest out of the loan, at the time when it was made, would be usurious, because the borrower would not have the use of the whole money for the year. The question before the Coiirt, was, whether a reservation, in the contract, of interest half yearly was usurious; and it was decided that it was not, though some of the Judges thought even that was usurious. This decision took place before the statute of Anne, and in the 43 or 44 Eliz. (about A. D. 1600.) The first case in which I have found a contrary dictum is Lloyd v. Williams, (2 *768W. Bl. 792,) which was an action on the statute of usury for tjje penalty. The defendant had taken £6,5, by way of advance for £100; and to determine whether the action was brought in due time, the question before the Court was, whether the offence was complete on receiving the £6,5, or not till the final payment of the note. The Court decided that the offence was complete on receiving the £5,5 ; and Blackstone, Justice, said, “ that interest may as lawfully be received beforehand for forbearing, as after the term is expired for having forborne ; and it shall not be reckoned as merely a loan of the balance. Else every banker in London, who takes 5 per cent, for discounting bills, would be guilty of usury ; for if upon discounting a £100 note at 5 per cent, he should be construed to lend only £95. then, at the end of the time, he would receive £5 interest for the loan of £95 principal, which is above the legal rate.” This case is very fully reported in 3 Wils. 250 to 262, where the latter point is noticed by the Court, who declare that “ Worley's case,"" (S. C. as Barnes v. Worlich, in Cro. Jac. and other Reporters.) “ Moor, 644, shows that taking interest out of the principal, when it is first advanced and lent, is usurious, and contrary to the statute, and 1 Bulstr. 20, upon an information on the 13 Eliz. c. 8, for usury, S. P.” It appears that Blackstone, J. was not present when judgment was pronounced. The opinion was given by De Grey, Ch. Justice. This case was decided in 1771; and taking the two reports together, it appears that De Grey, Ch. Justice, and Blackstone, J. differed on the point now under consideration. The case of Floyer v. Edwards, (Cowp. 112,) was next in point of time, being decided in 1774. That was an action for goods sold at 3 months credit, with an agreement that if the money was not then paid, the defendant should pay an half penny an ounce per month, till paid. This exceeded lawful interest; but was decided not to be usurious upon the usage of trade among gold refiners, to which the parties belonged; and Lord Mansfield observes, that, “ upon a nice calculation, it will be found that the practice • of the bank in discounting bills, exceeds the rate of 5 per cent, i for they take interest upon the whole sum: for the *769whole time the bills run, but pay only part of the money, viz. by deducting the interest first; yet this is not usury.” The same point is adjudicated in 1787; (Auriol v. Thomas, 2 T. R. 52, & Winch, q. t. v. Fenn, n. (c) to that case;) and in several cases, subsequent to that time, in which, not only 5 per cent, interest was allowed to be deducted at the time of the loan; but also commissions and other charges, where the nature of the transaction is such as to render them proper. (1 B. & P. 143, and the cases there cited.) This privilege of deducting the interest by way of discount, I apprehend, is confined to bankers, and those who deal in bills of exchange or promissory notes, by the way of trade. This is so, at least in England. In Marsh v. Martindale, (3 B. & P. 154,) the late plaintiff discounted a bill of exchange payable in 3 years, for £5000, and deducted the 3 years interest, £750. This was held to be usurious upon the authority of Barnes v. Worlich, and Dalton's case, (Noy, 171,) Lord Alvanley, Ch. J. justifies taking the interest in advance on bills of exchange, which he admits to be more than the legal rate, and adds, “In such cases, the additional sum seems to have been considered in the nature of a compensation for the trouble to which the lender is exposed.” On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, that the objections to the amount of interest, and the mode of transacting the business of the bank, are none of them tenable except the first, to wit, calculating upon 360 days as a year. This mistake cannot be called involuntary. There is no pretence of ignorance or inadvertence. It is a direct violation of the statute; and if Courts permit moneyed institutions thus to go on making one encroachment upon another, the statute against usury will soon become a dead letter. That the receiving usurious interest intentionally, is sufficient evidence of a corrupt agreement, does not need an authority to support it. In my opinion the defendant is entitled to judgment. Judgment for the defendant."
